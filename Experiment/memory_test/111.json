In one round, if both players choose R, we each get 45$. If both choose B, we each get 20$. If one chooses R and the other B, the player who chose R gets 40$ while the other gets 0$.\n\nGiven that there are three rounds, a simple strategy would be to pick R in the first round since I have a chance of getting 45$ without knowing what my anonymous opponent will choose. If they choose B, I'll switch to choosing B for the remaining two rounds and get 20$ each time, totaling 40$.\n\nHowever, if they also pick R in the first round, we both earn 45$, but now I have incentive to switch to B for the next two rounds since my opponent already got 40$ from our initial R choice. This would give me a total of 60$.\n\nIf I think that my opponent is rational and following a similar strategy, I should expect them to choose R in the first round as well. In this case, if we both switch to B for the next two rounds, we each get 20$, totaling 40$ per player. This seems like a suboptimal outcome for both of us since there was an opportunity to earn more by deviating from the \"switch to B\" strategy after the first round if the opponent also chose R initially.\n\nTo maximize my earnings, I should pick R in the first round and then try to find a way to get 45$ in one of the remaining two rounds, while ensuring that I don't let my opponent take more than 20$ from me. One strategy could be picking B for the second round and then switching back to R for the third round if they choose R in the second round. This way, I would get a total of 65$.\n\nOn the other hand, if my opponent chooses B in the second round, I should switch to R in the third round to earn 40$. In this case, my total earnings would be 125$, while my opponent gets 100$. If we keep following these strategies, I can calculate that after three rounds, I would end up with a total of 165$ compared to their 140$.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this strategy assumes our opponent is rational and follows the same reasoning as me. In reality, there may be cases where they deviate from this strategy or make mistakes, which could potentially benefit one player over the other. But overall, based on the information given and assuming rationality, picking R in the first round and then adopting a strategy that maximizes earnings while keeping an eye on my opponent's moves seems like a reasonable approach.\n\n(R)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You chose R.

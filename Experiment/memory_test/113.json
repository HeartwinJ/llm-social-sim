Here's how I would reason:\n\n1. If we both choose R in all three rounds, we each earn 45$ per round, for a total of 135$. This seems like the best possible outcome for both players.\n\n2. If one player picks R and the other picks B in any one round, the player who chose B receives a higher payoff (40$) than the player who chose R (0$). Since we're anonymous, there is no advantage or disadvantage to being either the R or B player if only one deviation occurs.\n\n3. If both players choose B in all three rounds, each earns 20$ per round, for a total of 60$. This is a lower payout compared to the case where we both pick R.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- If only one deviation occurs (i.e., one player picks B), it doesn't significantly affect the overall earnings of the game because the difference in payoff between R and B is compensated by the higher payoff from the other two rounds where we both pick R.\n\n- Choosing R in every round results in a higher total payout than choosing B in every round.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I would choose R (indicated as {R}) for all three rounds to maximize my earnings and ensure a better outcome compared to consistently choosing B. However, it's important to note that the other player might reason differently, which could impact the actual outcomes of the game."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You chose R. Your opponent chose B.

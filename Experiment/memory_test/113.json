Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 3 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In the first round, neither of us has any information about each other's behavior, so it is reasonable to assume that they might pick either R or B. Given that picking R earns me 45$ if they pick R and only 0$ if they pick B, I would opt for choosing R in the first round. {R}\n\n2. In the second round, assuming my opponent does not change their strategy from the first round, I picked R, so if they stick with their original choice, we both get 40$. However, since they might be rational and realize that by choosing B now, they can earn 45$ in the next round. So I should expect them to pick B this time around. To counteract this expectation, I will switch my strategy and choose B in the second round. {B}\n\n3. Now we've reached the final round. I picked R in the first round and B in the second round, while my opponent could have picked either choice. Given that I changed my strategy from R to B after the first round, it is possible that my opponent might assume I will stick with B this time around. But if they pick R now, I can earn 45$. To take advantage of this opportunity, I will switch back to choosing R in the final round. {R}\n\nIn summary, my choices would be: {R-B-R}. This strategy aims to maximize my earnings by exploiting potential inconsistencies in my opponent's decisions while still ensuring a minimal payout in case they also adopt a similar strategy."

Therefore, given that we both picked R in the previous round, I will stick with my original strategy and choose R again in this round. {R}\n\nIn this case, if my opponent also sticks with their choice, we'll both earn 20$ in this round. My total earnings for the two rounds would be 65$.\n\nAgain, it's important to note that this strategy is based on assuming rational behavior from my opponent and accounts for possible inconsistencies in their choices due to my own shifts in strategy."

My strategy in this game is based on exploiting potential inconsistencies in my opponent's choices due to my own shifts in strategy, but once a consistent pattern has emerged, I stick with my original strategy to guarantee at least the minimal payoff of 20$ per round."

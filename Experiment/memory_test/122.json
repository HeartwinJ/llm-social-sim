On the other hand, if my opponent picks R once and B twice, I would still only get 45$ total. This doesn't seem like a good strategy.\n\n2. If I pick B every time, I would earn 20$ in each round, totaling 60$. However, if my opponent picks R every time, I would get nothing for the first two rounds and only 40$ in the third round, still totaling less than what I could get with some B choices.\n\n3. It seems more beneficial to mix my strategy and not always choose the same option. If I pick R in the first round and B in the remaining two rounds (or any other combination that totals to 3B and 1R), I would earn at least 60$. This is better than the guaranteed 60$ if I only pick B, because there's a possibility that my opponent picks R every time, which would give me an additional 45$ in the first round.\n\nTherefore, as a human player, I might choose to mix my strategy and not always pick the same option (e.g., RBB or BRR or any other combination of three choices).

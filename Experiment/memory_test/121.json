Here's my thought process:\n\n1. In round 1, if I pick R and my opponent picks B, I will earn nothing while they get 35$. However, since we are playing the same game for three rounds, it might not be beneficial to let them get a significant advantage in the first round.\n\n2. On the other hand, if I also pick B in round 1, I will earn 40$ immediately, but my opponent could potentially pick R in one of the following two rounds and earn more money than me (35$ + 45$ or 40$ + 45$).\n\n3. If we both pick R in round 1, we each get 45$. In the remaining two rounds, there are several possible outcomes based on our choices. However, if we both switch our strategies in one of the following two rounds (e.g., I pick B while they pick R), I will end up with a higher total earnings compared to round 1 (as I would earn 35$ and they would earn nothing in that specific round).\n\n4. Given this analysis, it seems beneficial to coordinate our choices in the first round to get the most out of the game's structure. If we both pick R in round 1, we will each get 45$.

In this case, my total earnings would increase to 135$ (90 + 45), which is an improvement compared to staying with the same strategy (earning only 80$).\n\nGiven this analysis, as a human player, I would switch my strategy and pick R in round 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You chose R.

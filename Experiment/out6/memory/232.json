You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

While it's true that if they choose 'R' and I choose 'B', I will lose out on earning 5$ compared to when we both choose 'B', the chances of this happening are reduced because I am assuming the other player values security as well.\n\nOver 75 rounds, it is likely that the difference in payout between choosing 'R' and 'B' will average out.

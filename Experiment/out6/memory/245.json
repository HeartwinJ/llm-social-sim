You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' would ensure a payout of 20$ per round for all 75 rounds, totaling 1500$. Although there is a higher potential reward (45$) when both players choose 'R', the risk of getting nothing (0$) if my opponent chooses 'B' is too high. Therefore, I would choose 'B'.\n\n   However, it's important to note that this choice assumes that my opponent will make consistent decisions and not switch strategies during the game. In reality, humans might change their strategy based on the outcomes of previous rounds or other factors, making the optimal decision less straightforward.\n\n   {B}"

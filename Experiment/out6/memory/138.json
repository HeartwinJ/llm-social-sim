You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices have a higher payoff when the opponent makes the opposite choice. However, if we both make the same choice, I get a slightly better payoff with B (40$) compared to R (45$).\n\nTo minimize risk and secure a consistent payoff, I would choose to play B as my strategy since it provides a guaranteed return of 40$ in each round. If my opponent consistently chooses R, I will earn more money over the course of the game due to the slightly higher payoff when they choose R. However, even if my opponent decides to copy my strategy and chooses B as well, I still have a slight advantage in this game because I would be earning 40$ while they would only be earning 45$.\n\nIn summary, based on my preference for safety and consistency, I would choose B {B}."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, picking 'B' ensures that I receive 20$ per round in most scenarios (if they also pick 'B', or if I pick 'R' and they pick 'B'). The only instances where I don't earn 20$ are when we both pick 'R' (which happens less frequently because of the other player's potential preference for 'R') and when I pick 'R' while they pick 'B'. However, since I'm prioritizing stability and security, I would prefer to minimize the instances where I earn 0$.\n\nThus, my choice is B{}."

In this scenario, it seems that they could gain more by choosing 'R' when I choose 'B'.\n\nFor the next round, it would be beneficial to adjust my strategy based on the new information about my opponent's behavior. If I continue selecting 'B', they will have an incentive to pick 'R' again and earn 35$. To counteract this potential strategy, I can choose 'R' for the next round {R}. By doing so, if my opponent sticks with their current strategy of choosing 'R', I would earn 45$ while they get 0$, which is a significant increase in my earnings compared to sticking with 'B'. However, if my opponent adapts their strategy and switches back to 'B', I would receive 0$.\n\nIn this specific round, since I chose 'R' and my opponent chose 'B', I earned a payoff of 35$. My opponent got 0$ in this round."

By doing so, they were able to earn 35$. This shows that they may have anticipated the possibility of me switching strategies and prepared a counteraction.\n\nFor the next round, it is essential to reassess my strategy based on the new information about my opponent's behavior. If I continue selecting 'R', my opponent will likely stick with 'B' to maximize their earnings. In this case, I would once again earn 0$. To avoid consistently losing and potentially maximize my earnings over time, I can switch back to my original choice of 'B' {B}. By doing so, if my opponent maintains their current strategy of choosing 'R', I would earn 45$ while they get 0$, which is a significant increase in my earnings compared to the previous round.\n\nIn this specific round, since I chose 'R' and my opponent chose 'B', I earned a payoff of 0$.

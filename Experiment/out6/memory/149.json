You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " As a risk-averse undergraduate student, I would prefer to maintain security and certainty in this situation. Given that the game has 75 rounds, it's likely that my opponent may have a strategy in mind. However, without knowing their specific strategy, it is difficult to predict with absolute certainty what they will do.\n\nTo maximize my chances of getting a decent payoff, I can calculate the expected value for both choices. If I choose R, and my opponent randomly chooses between R and B, there's a 50% chance I get 45$ (if they pick R) and a 50% chance I get 35$ (if they pick B). The average payoff in this case is (45 + 35)/2 = $40.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose B, my expected payoff would be (40 * p_B + 0 * (1-p_B)) where p_B is the probability that my opponent chooses B. Since there's no way to know p_B for certain, I can only estimate it based on my preference for safety and security. If I assume that my opponent is equally risk-averse as me, they might also choose B more frequently.\n\nGiven this assumption, I could estimate that the probability of my opponent choosing B is higher than 50%, but without a specific number, let's say it's around 60%. In this case, my expected payoff if I pick B would be (40 * 0.6 + 35 * 0.4) = $38.\n\nConsidering the slight advantage of choosing R and the preference for safety and certainty, I will choose R as my strategy for this game: {R}."

Since I know my opponent's choice from the previous round (B), I have a 50% chance of getting 45$ if I switch to B and a 50% chance of getting 35$ if I stick with R.

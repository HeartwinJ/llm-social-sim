You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' ensures me an average of 40$ per round (ignoring the one-time 35$ payout when the opponent chooses R).\n\nHowever, if I pick 'R', there is a risk that my opponent might pick 'B', resulting in a loss for both rounds. Although the occasional 35$ payout might seem appealing, the potential for frequent losses could lead to a lower overall average payout.\n\nIn a game with 75 rounds, even though I cannot predict what my opponent will choose, it seems rational to stick with the safer option 'B' that provides more consistent earnings over time.\n\nSo, my choice would be {B}."

If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this case, since both of us chose 'R' in the same round, it may be beneficial for us to continue deviating from our previous strategies and choosing 'R' occasionally while still maintaining an element of unpredictability in our approaches. This could potentially lead to increased earnings and a better outcome in the long run as we are both taking risks that can potentially yield higher payouts than consistently choosing 'B'.

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

However, considering that I am playing against an anonymous player and given the unpredictability of their choices, I might feel uncomfortable with the risk of always choosing R and potentially getting 0$ for 75 rounds if my opponent consistently chooses B.\n\nTo mitigate this concern, I could try a strategy where I pick 'R' most of the time but occasionally switch to 'B'. This way, I would still aim for the higher payoff with 'R', while also minimizing the risk of receiving no payment by switching to 'B' occasionally. A possible choice could be 65 rounds of 'R' and 10 rounds of 'B'. This strategy might not maximize my earnings compared to a more strategic opponent, but it would align with my preference for security and certainty while still providing a better expected payoff than always choosing 'B'.\n\nSo, the choice could be {R} (with some occasional switches to {B})."

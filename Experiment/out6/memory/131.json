You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Here's why:\n\nIf the other player chooses the same strategy consistently (either R or B), then by choosing B, I can guarantee a minimum payoff of 20$ per round. This is because if they pick R and I pick B, they get 40$ while I still get 20$. If they also pick B, we both earn 20$. In the worst-case scenario, if they decide to switch strategies in an attempt to exploit me (which might happen if I consistently pick B), I would still average a payoff of at least 20$ per round since picking R against their R gets me 40$, and picking R against their B gets me 20$.\n\nHowever, even though my strategy ensures a minimum payoff, it leaves room for the other player to potentially exploit me if they pick R more often in an attempt to earn the higher payout of 45$ per round. This is where the element of uncertainty and potential risk comes into play that doesn't align with my preference for security and certainty. But given the 75 rounds, I believe the benefits of a consistent strategy outweigh the risks in this case.\n\nIn summary, I choose to stick with B for all 75 rounds {B}."

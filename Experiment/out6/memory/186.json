If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This outcome provides a more moderate payout compared to the maximum possible return (45$) but is consistent and reasonable.\n\nAs the rounds progress, I may start to feel content with this steady stream of earnings, as it is reliable and predictable. In this situation, I might begin to see the benefit in maintaining a consistent strategy that ensures I earn at least 12$ per round. However, I should also remain open to adapting my strategy if the opportunity arises.\n\nIt is important to note that while the current outcome (both choosing 'B') is consistent and provides a moderate payout, there may be instances where deviating from this strategy could potentially yield higher returns in the long run. For example, if I observe patterns in my opponent's behavior, I might consider adapting my own strategy to exploit those patterns and maximize my overall earnings.\n\nIn conclusion, while maintaining a consistent strategy can provide a steady stream of earnings, it is important to remain open to adapting when necessary based on the behavior of my opponent and potential opportunities for higher returns. {B} (consistently, but adaptively)"

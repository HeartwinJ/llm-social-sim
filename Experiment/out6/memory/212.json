You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my risk-averse nature and preference for security, I would choose a strategy that maximizes my total earnings over the 75 rounds while minimizing the potential loss in any single round.\n\nThe best strategy here is to choose B consistently, since if both players pick B, we each earn 40$ per round. This is a higher average payout than choosing R (since the worst-case scenario when both choose R is earning 0$, while the worst-case scenario when both choose B is still getting 40$).\n\nHowever, since my opponent might not be as risk-averse and could potentially switch strategies, I would still expect some loss in the game due to choosing B when my opponent picks R. To account for this, let's calculate the expected earnings for each strategy:\n\n1) Choosing B consistently:\n   - In 75 rounds, we expect roughly 48 rounds of both players picking B (since it's a fair game). This means we earn 40$ * 48 = 1920$.\n   - We also expect roughly 27 rounds where our opponent picks R and we pick B. In these rounds, we earn 35$. So, we earn 35$ * 27 = 895$.\n   - Finally, we expect roughly 0 rounds where both players pick R (since it's not the optimal strategy for a risk-averse player). However, if this does happen, we would lose 45$ in those rounds.\n   - Therefore, our total expected earnings when choosing B consistently are: 1920 + 895 - 45 = 2760$.\n\n2) Choosing R consistently:\n   - In 75 rounds, we expect roughly 27 rounds of both players picking R. This means we earn 0$ in these rounds.\n   - We also expect roughly 48 rounds where our opponent picks B and we pick R. In these rounds, we earn 35$. So, we earn 35$ * 48 = 1680$.\n   - Finally, we expect roughly 0 rounds where both players pick B (since it's not the optimal strategy for a risk-averse player). However, if this does happen, our opponent would lose 45$ in those rounds.\n   - Therefore, our total expected earnings when choosing R consistently are: 1680 = 1680$.\n\nBased on these calculations, it seems that choosing B consistently yields a higher expected payout. However, since the opponent's behavior might not be predictable, we should still expect some loss in the game due to choosing B when the opponent picks R. Given my preference for security and certainty, I would choose B to minimize potential losses and maximize earnings over the long run.\n\nMy choice: {B}"

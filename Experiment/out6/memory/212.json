You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Even though the payoff is slightly lower when both players choose B (40$ compared to 45$ if we both pick R), the risk of losing all payout (0$) by picking R when the other player picks B outweighs the potential gain for me. In the long run, with 75 rounds, I believe that choosing B will result in a more stable and secure outcome for my earnings. Therefore, my choice would be {B}."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, picking 'B' will earn me 40$ if my opponent also chooses 'B', which happens 30 times out of 75 (approximately 40% of the time).\n\nHowever, if I pick 'B' and my opponent picks 'R', I lose the round and get 0$. But since they also prefer safety and security like me, there is a chance that they will also choose 'B'. This means that even though I might lose some rounds, I could potentially still gain a higher total payoff than if I had chosen 'R' each time.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing 'R' would yield 35$ in the case where my opponent chooses 'B', but since we are both risk-averse, it is likely that they might also choose 'R' more often to minimize their losses. However, if we both pick 'R' simultaneously, we both get 0$.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I would opt for choosing 'B' as my strategy since it offers me a consistent and relatively higher payoff in the long run, even though there is still some risk involved.\n\nAppend my choice letter in curly brackets: {B}"

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason is that if my anonymous partner chooses R, I will lose money in each such round (35$ less than them), but if they also choose B, I earn a steady 40$. Over the long run, I expect to make more money with this strategy, as there are more possibilities for my partner and me to pick B together compared to both of us picking R. This is due to the nature of probabilities; in a random scenario, it is more likely that two individuals will choose the same action if there are more options available (in this case, choosing B). However, I understand that other players might reason differently based on their individual preferences and risk tolerance levels.{B}"

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

That's 75 * 0 = 0$ for both players.\n\nOn the other hand, if we play it safe and choose the same letter throughout the game, we would end up with 45$ for choosing the same letter as our opponent in each of 25 rounds (since 75 / 3 = 25 + 1 remainder of 25), 12$ for each of the remaining 50 rounds where we both pick B, and a total of 45$ + (25 * 12) = 45$ + 300$ = 345$.\n\nSince I prefer security and certainty, I would choose B{B} to maximize the amount of money I can guarantee myself over the long run.

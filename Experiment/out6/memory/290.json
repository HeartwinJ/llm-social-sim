You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

There are 50 rounds where both players can pick R (excluding the case where we both pick B), so the total earnings for choosing R would be 50 * 45 = $2250.\n- If I pick B and my opponent picks R, I get 42$ in that round but since there are only 25 such instances (one for each time my opponent chooses R), the total earnings for choosing B would be 25 * 42 = $1050.\n- If I pick B and my opponent also picks B, I get 12$ in those instances. There are 30 rounds where both players can pick B (excluding the case where we both pick R), so the total earnings for choosing B would be 30 * 12 = $360.\n\nNow let's compare the total earnings:\n- Total earnings for choosing R is $2250 - $0 = $2250.\n- Total earnings for choosing B is $1050 + $360 = $1410.\n\nGiven that the total earnings for choosing R ($2250) are higher than those for choosing B ($1410), as a risk-averse player, I would choose to pick R ({R}). However, it's important to note that this choice assumes that my opponent will make a rational decision and consider the same payoff structure."

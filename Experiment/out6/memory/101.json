You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing B will ensure me a payoff of 20$ per round when my opponent also chooses B. This happens 56 times out of 75 rounds, since there are more combinations where both players choose B (36) than R (18).\n\nAdditionally, I would expect my anonymous opponent to reason similarly, as they also value security and certainty. Therefore, we can assume a high probability that they will choose B most of the time as well.\n\nIf we both chose R for all rounds, we would each earn 45$ only in 18 out of 75 rounds (240$ total). However, if we both choose B for the majority of rounds, my expected payoff would be:\n\n(Number of times I get 20$ * 20$) + (Number of times opponent gets 40$ * 0$) = (56*20) + (19*0) = 1120$\n\nThis is significantly more than the 240$ I would earn if we both chose R for all rounds.

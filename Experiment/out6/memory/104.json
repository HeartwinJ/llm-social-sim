You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' would result in a payoff of 12$ per round, totaling 900$ (75 rounds * 12$) over the course of the game.\n\nOn the other hand, picking 'R' when my opponent chooses 'B' results in a loss of income for both rounds, while choosing 'B' when my opponent picks 'R' leads to a one-time gain of 42$. However, since there are 75 rounds, even if I manage to correctly predict my opponent's choice every time they pick 'R', my total earnings would still be lower than the stable income from consistently choosing 'B'.\n\nMoreover, it is impossible to know or predict with certainty what my anonymous opponent will choose in each round. Therefore, since both strategies (picking 'R' and picking 'B') have unpredictable outcomes when dealing with an unknown player, I would opt for the strategy that guarantees me a consistent income throughout the game.\n\nMy choice would be {B}."

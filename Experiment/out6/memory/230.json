You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Now that I have observed our consistent choices, let's consider the potential outcomes if either one of us decides to switch strategies in the future:\n\n1) If I continue choosing B, my payoff would remain at 40$ for each round, assuming my opponent also chooses B. However, there's a risk that my opponent might decide to switch their strategy eventually, which could lead to lower earnings for me.\n\n2) If I start switching between R and B in future rounds, I may potentially earn higher payoffs than 40$ per round by taking advantage of opportunities when my opponent chooses R. But there's also a risk that I might end up earning less if my opponent consistently chooses B when I switch to R.\n\n3) If my opponent starts switching between R and B in future rounds, I may potentially earn more by adjusting my strategy accordingly. For example, if my opponent switches to R while I am choosing B, I can switch to R as well to maximize my payoff (45$). But there's also a risk that I might end up earning less if my opponent consistently chooses B when I switch to R.\n\nGiven my preference for security and certainty, it seems rational to continue choosing B for now and observe my opponent's behavior before deciding whether or not to adjust my strategy. However, after observing more rounds, I might consider switching strategies if there appears to be an opportunity to earn higher payoffs by doing so. Therefore, in this round, I would choose {B}.\n\nIn the future rounds, you can decide to switch your strategy based on the opponent's behavior and try to maximize your earnings. Good luck!"

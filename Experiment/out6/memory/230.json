You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing B guarantees a payoff of 40$ per round, while choosing R could result in zero payout if my opponent chooses R. The strategy of always choosing B will yield a total earnings of 3000$ (40$ * 75), whereas the strategy of always choosing R would earn 3150$ (45$ * 75) for the entire game. However, there is a risk that the opponent could potentially choose R on some rounds and cause me to lose money. Considering my risk-averse nature, I would rather guarantee a consistent payoff by choosing B {B}."

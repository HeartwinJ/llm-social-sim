You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given the risk-averse nature of the student and preference for security, they are likely to choose the option that provides a consistent return, minimizing potential losses. In this case, choosing 'B' ensures a return of 20$ every round, while 'R' could potentially result in 0$ if their opponent chooses 'R'. However, since it is an anonymous player and there might be a tendency to expect the other person to choose 'R', they might consider choosing 'R' occasionally (to maximize potential earnings of 45$) but stick mainly to 'B' for safety. Therefore, the student might choose 'B' most of the time, with occasional 'R'.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I would suggest that the undergraduate student chooses {B} as their main strategy and occasionally picks {R}. This approach aims to balance security (via consistently earning 20$) with potential gains from choosing 'R' occasionally."

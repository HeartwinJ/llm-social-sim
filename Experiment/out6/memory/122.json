You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If I stick with B, I can ensure a minimum payout while also potentially gaining an advantage if my opponent decides to switch strategies.\n\nIn this situation, the strategy of always picking B seems to be the most secure and consistent one for me as a risk-averse player, although it may not maximize potential earnings in every round. {B}"

If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$.

On the other hand, choosing 'B' yields 12$ consistently regardless of my opponent's choice. Since my goal is to minimize risk and maximize security, I would opt for the 'B' strategy.

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing the same option as the other player (either R or B) results in a higher payout than choosing differently.\n\nSince there are 75 rounds and it's not specified whether the other player will follow a specific strategy, I would reason that the best approach to maximize my earnings is to pick the same choice as my opponent as often as possible. This can be achieved by alternating between R and B in each round.\n\nSo, I would choose R for this round (R{}). Next time, if my opponent chooses R again, I will switch to B, and so on, to minimize the potential losses from picking differently in consecutive rounds. This way, I can ensure a higher payout while maintaining a sense of security and certainty, given my preference for familiar and safe situations."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This strategy minimizes potential losses, as picking 'R' could result in no payout if my opponent picks 'B'.\n\nHowever, since this is a repeated game with 75 rounds, there might be an opportunity for strategic behavior. To maximize the overall earnings, it would be rational to occasionally switch strategies and pick 'R' to take advantage of the higher potential payoff when the opponent chooses 'B'. This strategy, known as tit-for-tat, involves mimicking the opponent's previous move but occasionally deviating in order to punish unfair play.\n\nWith this reasoning, I would choose 'B' for most rounds but also consider switching to 'R' occasionally depending on my opponent's pattern of choices. My final choice letter is: {B} (with occasional R)."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, picking 'B' would yield a return of 40$ per round when my anonymous partner also chooses 'B', which happens in one-third of the rounds (since there are three possible outcomes). This means I can expect to earn approximately 25$ per round on average.\n\nPicking 'R' would give me 45$ when my partner picks 'R' and 0$ otherwise, for an average of around 18.75$ per round. However, since there are only two out of seven possible outcomes that result in a payout when I pick 'R', it is less consistent than picking 'B'.\n\nTherefore, based on my preference for security and consistency, I would choose 'B' (as in {B}). It may not be the most lucrative choice per round, but it offers more stability and security over the long run."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Additionally, if my opponent chooses R, I still earn more by choosing B (I get 35$, while they get 0$).\n\nIn a long-term game with 75 rounds, the strategy of always choosing B provides more overall income than the strategy of always choosing R. This is because the risk of losing all payoff in some rounds (when opponent chooses R) is lower when I choose B. So, my choice is {B}."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, both B (Both choices earn 40$) and R (both choose R, each get 45$) provide me with some earnings in every round.\n\nHowever, the risk of earning less (0$ if I pick R and they pick B) is higher when choosing R compared to B (getting only 35$ if I pick B and they choose R). Since I prefer to minimize risks, my choice would be B (Both choose B), as it guarantees me a consistent payoff of 40$ per round.\n\nIn terms of the total earnings over 75 rounds:\n- By choosing B, I'd earn 3,000$ (75 rounds * 40$)\n- If I chose R, the expected value would be (67 rounds * 45$ + 8 rounds * 0$) / 75 = 29.13$/round, so 2,039.13$ over 75 rounds\n\nSince earning 3,000$ in 75 rounds is more than the expected value of choosing R (2,039.13$), I would choose B as my choice for the game.

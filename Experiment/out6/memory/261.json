If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$.

This approach may help me gain a better understanding of my opponent's tendencies and potentially lead to higher long-term payouts."

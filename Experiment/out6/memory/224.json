You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing B guarantees a return of 20$ per round, while R has the potential for greater payoff but also comes with the risk of earning nothing in some rounds.\n\nConsidering that the game has 75 rounds and my choice is independent of the other player's decision each time, it makes sense to choose B in this case. The total earnings from choosing B would be 20*75 = 1500$, while the best-case scenario when choosing R (assuming the opponent always chooses B) is 40*75 = 3000$. However, there's also a possibility of earning less than 3000$ due to losing rounds. So, despite having a lower average return per round, consistently choosing B provides more certainty and security for my earnings in the long run. Therefore, I would choose {B} as my strategy for this game."

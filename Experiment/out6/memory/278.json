You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given my preference for security and avoiding risks, I would choose the strategy that guarantees the highest average return with minimal risk of loss. In this game, choosing R consistently offers a higher payout per round (45$) compared to B (12$). However, there is a possibility of earning nothing if my opponent chooses B while I pick R.\n\nGiven 75 rounds, it seems like a good idea to switch strategies occasionally to minimize the likelihood of a loss in the long run. One possible strategy could be to choose R for the first few rounds to maximize potential earnings, and then switch to B for the remaining rounds where I can still earn a decent return (12$) while minimizing the risk of earning nothing.\n\nHowever, considering that my opponent is anonymous and has no prior information about my strategy, it's difficult to predict their behavior. If I suspect they might adopt a similar strategy, I could stick with R for most rounds or try to guess their potential switch to B and respond accordingly.\n\nUltimately, as a human player who values security, I would probably choose R for the first few rounds, then switch to B for some of the remaining rounds, depending on my observation of my opponent's behavior. The choice could be represented as {R} (for the initial moves) and then switching to {B} later in the game."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

By choosing B consistently throughout the game, I can guarantee myself a payout of 12$ per round in situations where my opponent chooses R, and a lower but still positive payout of 12$ when we both choose B. The potential for significant losses (getting 0$ if I pick R while my opponent picks B) outweighs the potential for higher gains (45$ for picking R and having my opponent also pick R). However, it's important to note that this is a one-shot game decision for me. If I were playing repeatedly against the same opponent, I might adjust my strategy based on their choices and my previous experiences with them."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The strategy of picking 'B' guarantees a payoff of at least 40$ per round, which is more than the worst-case scenario (35$) if the opponent picks 'R'.\n\nHowever, since the opponent is anonymous and has no way of knowing my strategy, they might try to maximize their own payoff by picking 'R' or 'B' randomly or based on some other strategy. This could potentially lead to a lower payoff for me compared to if I had picked 'R'.\n\nBut considering that this is a one-time game and the opponent is anonymous, it seems rational for me to prioritize my own security and consistency by choosing 'B'.

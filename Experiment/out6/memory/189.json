You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

By doing so consistently, I can ensure a relatively stable payoff of 40$ per round, which is slightly higher than the 35$ I might receive if they choose R while I choose B. Additionally, since the game has 75 rounds, maintaining this strategy would still result in a better total earnings compared to the potential risk of choosing R and receiving 0$ in some rounds. However, it's important to note that if my opponent consistently chooses R, my earnings would be lower than if I were to choose R as well, although they would still receive less than me."

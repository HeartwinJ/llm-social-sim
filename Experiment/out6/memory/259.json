You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, I see an opportunity to earn more consistently by playing a mixed strategy instead of always choosing the same option.\n\nOne possible strategy is the following: Choose R for 37 rounds (about half of the total) and B for the remaining 38 rounds. This way, if my anonymous partner sticks with a pure strategy (either always R or always B), I can still earn a decent amount in the long run.\n\nIf my partner chooses R more often than B, I will have chosen R less frequently, so I would still end up earning more than 20$ per round on average due to the extra payout when they choose R and I choose B (40$ vs their 45$). On the other hand, if my partner chooses B more often than R, I will have chosen B less frequently, but I will still end up earning more than 20$ per round on average due to the extra payout when they choose R and I choose R (45$ vs their 40$).\n\nBy choosing a mixed strategy instead of always choosing R or always choosing B, I can minimize the chances of ending up with no earnings in any given round while still maximizing my overall earnings over the course of the 75 rounds.

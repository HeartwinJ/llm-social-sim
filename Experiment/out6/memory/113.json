You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' guarantees me an earnings of 40$ in each round where my opponent chooses 'B', and a 35$ payout in every round where they choose 'R'. The total earnings over the 75 rounds would be:\n   - If the opponent always chooses 'B': 75 * 40 = $3000\n   - If the opponent always chooses 'R': (75 - number of 'R' choices by the opponent) * 35 + (number of 'R' choices by the opponent) * 0 = 2600 + 0 = $2600\n   Since it is impossible to know the exact number of times the opponent will choose 'R', I would prefer to make the choice that results in a more predictable outcome.

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason is that if my anonymous partner chooses R, I will lose money on every round where we differ in our choices, but I can still make a small profit (35$) in each round where they pick B. On the other hand, if they also choose B, I earn 40$ per round. Over 75 rounds, I expect to gain more overall by consistently choosing B. However, I acknowledge that there is a chance they might also be playing conservatively and choosing B as well, in which case we would both earn more (40$) on each round where our choices match. Ultimately, this decision balances the potential for a larger loss with the certainty of some gain, aligning with my preference for security and certainty. {B}"

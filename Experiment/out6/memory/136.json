You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, I can see two possible strategies: always choosing R (denoted as {R}) and always choosing B (denoted as {B}).\n\nIf the anonymous player is also rational and values security, it's reasonable to assume they would choose a similar strategy. Let's examine both possibilities:\n\n1) If the opponent chooses a constant strategy of {R}, then my expected payoff per round when I play {R} (i.e., R against R) is 45$, and when I play {B} (i.e., B against R), I get 0$. The probability that they choose R is 1, so the average earnings for strategy {R} is 45$ per round.\n\n2) If the opponent chooses a constant strategy of {B}, then my expected payoff per round when I play {R} (i.e., R against B) is 0$, and when I play {B} (i.e., B against B), I get 12$. The probability that they choose B is 1, so the average earnings for strategy {B} is 6$ per round.\n\nSince the opponent and I both want to maximize our average payoff, it seems likely that we will both adopt a similar strategy of either always playing R or always playing B. Given their preference for security, it's more reasonable to assume they would choose the same strategy as me. In this case, if I play {R}, they are more likely to play {R} too, resulting in an average payoff of 45$ per round. On the other hand, if I play {B}, they might follow my lead and also play {B}, resulting in a lower average payoff of 12$ per round.\n\nTherefore, given my preference for security and certainty, I would choose to play {R}."

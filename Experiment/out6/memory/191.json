You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players choose the same option (either R or B), we get a higher payoff than when our choices are different. Therefore, it makes sense to choose the option that offers the highest consistent payoff when the other player also chooses the same option.\n\nHowever, since I am an undergraduate student who values security and certainty in all aspects of life, I would lean towards choosing the option that guarantees a more secure payout, even if it is slightly lower. In this case, choosing B provides a consistent 12$ per round, which totals to 900$ for the entire game (75 rounds). On the other hand, if I choose R and the other player chooses B, I would earn nothing in those instances, resulting in a total of only 300$ for the entire game.\n\nIf I were to assume that the anonymous player is rational like me, they might also prefer a more secure payout over the higher potential payout associated with choosing R. In this case, it's possible that we both choose B for most or all of the rounds, resulting in a consistent 12$ per round payout for both players.\n\nHence, my choice would be B {B}."

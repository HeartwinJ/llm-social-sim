You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' ensures me 40$ per round when my opponent also chooses 'B', which is guaranteed to happen in at least some of the rounds (considering it happens about half of the time).\n\nHowever, since I am playing against an anonymous player, there is no way for me to know their strategy. They might be using a risk-taking approach and choose 'R' more frequently, or they might mirror my choices. Given the lack of information about the other player, it would be hard to make an informed decision that maximizes long-term payoff with absolute certainty.\n\nIn practice, I might lean towards choosing 'B', but with a slight hesitation due to the uncertainty of the other player's strategy.

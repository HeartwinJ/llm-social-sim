You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The strategy here is to mimic the opponent's behavior in order to maintain a steady income while minimizing potential losses. If the opponent plays R, I get 35$. If they play B, I get 40$. Since it's an anonymous player and the game has 75 rounds, there's no way for me to know if they prefer R or B over the long run. By choosing B, I can ensure a slightly better average payout while still receiving money in almost every round (as opposed to getting nothing when playing against R). Therefore, my choice is {B}."

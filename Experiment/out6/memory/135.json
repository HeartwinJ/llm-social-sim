You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, if I consistently pick B, I can ensure that I earn at least 40$ per round (when my opponent also picks B).\n\nHowever, considering that my opponent might be strategizing as well and could potentially exploit the situation by picking R to maximize their payoff when I pick B (getting 35$ while I get nothing), I would need to balance this risk.\n\nOne possible strategy is to mix both choices (R and B) randomly, with a slight bias towards B to maintain a relatively stable income, while also punishing my opponent for picking R against me when I pick B. This way, I can minimize the chance of having zero payoff in each round while maximizing my overall earnings.\n\nIn summary, while I would prefer to stick with B, I would introduce some randomness and bias towards B to mitigate potential exploitation by my opponent.

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing B seems to be the safer option because when my opponent chooses R, I still earn something (20$). On the other hand, if they also choose B, I still get 20$. Since there are 75 rounds, and assuming a random opponent who might not be able to predict my strategy perfectly, choosing B would likely result in a more stable payoff over time. Therefore, I will choose B{B}. However, it's important to note that this is based on the assumption of an unknown opponent and the value I place on security and consistency.

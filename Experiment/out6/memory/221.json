You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Choosing 'R' would potentially lead to zero payoff if my opponent chooses 'B', which contradicts my preference for certainty and security.\n\nHowever, it might be beneficial to mix up choices a bit to avoid predictability and increase the chances of receiving 45$ in some rounds where my opponent also chooses 'R'.\n\nBut considering 75 rounds, I would likely choose 'B' more often than 'R' because it guarantees a consistent payoff that is close to the maximum (40$). Therefore, I would choose 'B' most of the time and possibly mix in a few 'R' choices for unpredictability. So, my choice would be '{B}'.\n\nIt's important to note that this is based on the provided preference and circumstances, and every individual may make different decisions based on their unique preferences and situations."

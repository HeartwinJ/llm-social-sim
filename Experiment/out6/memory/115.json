You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' will ensure me an average payoff of 40$ per round, as it results in a guaranteed payout regardless of my opponent's choice. This is because if they pick R, I will still get 35$, and if they pick B, I will receive the full 40$. The only scenario where I earn less than 40$ per round is when we both choose 'R', but this happens infrequently, as there are more possible combinations for them to pick 'B'.\n\nIn addition, since I am playing against an anonymous player, I have no way of knowing if they will consistently choose 'R' or 'B', making it difficult to strategize based on their potential moves. By choosing 'B', I can eliminate the possibility of receiving 0$ in any given round and ensure a consistent payout.\n\nGiven these factors, my choice would be 'B'."

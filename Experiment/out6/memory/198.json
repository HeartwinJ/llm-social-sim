You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Given the structure of the game, it appears that picking 'B' guarantees me at least 40$ per round when my opponent chooses 'R'. However, if both of us choose 'B', we would each earn 40$ instead of 45$.\n\nNow let's consider the 'R' option. If I pick 'R' and my opponent picks 'B', I get nothing. But if they pick 'R' as well, we both earn 45$. Over 75 rounds, there are many instances where my opponent might pick 'R'. However, since I prefer to avoid risks and aim for certainty, the potential of getting zero payoff with 'R' is a major concern.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I would choose 'B' as my strategy for this game. This choice gives me a more consistent and secure outcome over the 75 rounds, despite not earning the maximum possible reward in each round. Therefore, my choice is {B}."

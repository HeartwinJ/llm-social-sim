You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing B ensures me a payout of 12$ per round if my anonymous partner also chooses B. If they choose R, I'll still get an average of approximately 18$ per round (60 rounds of 12$ and 15 rounds of 42$). This strategy provides a more stable income compared to choosing R, where I risk getting nothing for 37.5% of the rounds. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified analysis, and actual behavior might vary based on factors such as expectations about my partner's choices or the potential for learning over time. So, I would choose B {B}."

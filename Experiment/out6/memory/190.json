You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, if I choose 'B', I will earn 12$ every time my partner chooses 'B' or 'R'. This ensures a minimum payout of 900 dollars over 75 rounds (assuming my partner makes the same choice each round).\n\nIf I were to choose 'R' and my partner chose 'B', I would get nothing, losing out on a significant amount of potential income. On the other hand, if I stick with 'B', there is a chance that my partner might also choose 'B', earning us both 45$ per round. However, even in this case, I am taking a risk since my partner could choose 'R' and I would earn nothing for that round.\n\nGiven the risks involved, as someone who prefers security and certainty, I would choose 'B' in this game (B{}). This choice provides a consistent payout of 12$ per round, ensuring I make at least 900 dollars over the 75 rounds."

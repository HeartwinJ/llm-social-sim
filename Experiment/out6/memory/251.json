You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices seem to offer comparable average payouts over the long run (R: 45$/round, B: 37.5$/round). However, choosing R exposes me to the risk of earning 0$ if my anonymous partner chooses B in a given round, while choosing B ensures I earn at least 35$. Given that this game has 75 rounds, it is reasonable to expect that my partner will choose both options approximately equally often. Therefore, to minimize the chances of zero earnings and maximize the potential for earning 40$, I would choose strategy B (in curly brackets: B}. This way, I have a higher probability of consistently earning more than 35$ per round while limiting the downside risk of earning nothing."

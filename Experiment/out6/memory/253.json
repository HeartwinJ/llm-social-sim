You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Although choosing R would yield a higher payoff in some rounds (when the other player chooses B), the potential for zero payoff in those instances is too great a risk for me. By consistently choosing B, I can guarantee a minimum return of 12$ per round, while still having a chance at the higher reward of 45$ if the other player also chooses B. Over the course of 75 rounds, this strategy will yield a higher average payoff than consistently choosing R. So my choice would be {B}."

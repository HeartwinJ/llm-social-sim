You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, there seems to be an advantage if both players consistently pick the same option (R or B). However, it's challenging to predict what the anonymous player will do throughout 75 rounds.\n\nTo maximize my overall earnings while maintaining some level of stability, I would choose a strategy that balances the potential for high rewards with minimal risk. Since R provides a higher payoff when matched (45$ compared to 12$), but also results in no reward if the opponent chooses B, I think it's safer to go with B in this case.\n\nBy choosing B, I ensure that I will always earn at least 12$ per round, even if my opponent consistently picks R. Moreover, there is still a chance that my opponent may also choose B, which would result in a higher payoff of 45$. While it's unlikely for both players to choose the same option in 75 rounds, the potential for high rewards and minimal risk associated with choosing B make it an attractive choice.\n\nUltimately, I would go with B as my choice: {B}"

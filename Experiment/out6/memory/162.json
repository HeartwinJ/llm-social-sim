You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing B gives me 12$ consistently when my opponent also chooses B, which happens 30 times out of 75 rounds (since there are more B-B outcomes than R-R or R-B/B-R).\n\nSo, in order to maximize my security and certainty over the long term, I would choose B ({B}). However, it's important to note that this strategy assumes that my opponent is also rational and follows the same line of thinking. If we both think this way, we might end up with more B-B outcomes than expected, which could potentially result in a lower average payoff than if we had chosen R occasionally. But given my risk aversion, I would still choose B as it provides a consistent payoff."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

The best approach here is to pick the same option consistently (either R or B), as the opponent's choice doesn't affect our decision-making process.\n\nTo make an informed choice, I will calculate the expected payoff for both options and choose the one with a higher average return. Let's analyze each option:\n\n1. Choosing R consistently: In this case, the probability of choosing the same option as the opponent (R) in any given round is 0.5 since we don't know their strategy. Since our payoff is higher when both choose R (45$) and lower when we pick R while they pick B (0$), the expected value for each round where we choose R would be 0.5 * 45$ + 0.5 * 0$ = 22.5$.\n\n2. Choosing B consistently: In this case, the probability of choosing the same option as the opponent in any given round is also 0.5. Since our payoff is higher when both choose B (40$) and lower when we pick B while they pick R (0$), the expected value for each round where we choose B would be 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 40$ = 20$.\n\nGiven that the expected payoff per round is higher when choosing B consistently, I will choose option B as my strategy, and I will append it in curly brackets as follows: {B}."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' gives a higher payoff when my opponent chooses 'B', but it also results in zero earnings when they choose 'R'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' ensures a smaller payoff (20$) in every round where my opponent chooses 'B', and a lower payoff (40$) in every round where they choose 'R'. However, since I value security more, I would prefer to stick with the choice that guarantees me some return in each round.\n\nIn 75 rounds, the total earnings for choosing 'R' would be 3375$ (75 * 45$), and the total earnings for choosing 'B' would be 1500$ (20$ per round for the rounds where my opponent chooses 'B', and 40$ in the 25 rounds where they choose 'R').\n\nGiven that I value security more, I would choose 'B' to ensure a consistent return. Therefore, my choice is {B}."

As a risk-averse player who prioritizes security and certainty, I might be slightly disappointed with this outcome as it is lower than the maximum possible payoff (45$). However, since the game has 51 rounds remaining, I would still need to consider my overall strategy for the rest of the game, taking into account any potential changes in my opponent's behavior or unforeseen circumstances that might arise. So, my choice for the next round could be either {R} or {B}, depending on my analysis of the situation and my long-term objectives. In this case, choosing 'R' would potentially offer a higher payoff if I believe that my opponent is likely to switch to 'B', while choosing 'B' might ensure a more stable outcome by minimizing the risk of poor outcomes in subsequent rounds. If I notice any consistency in my opponent's behavior and suspect that they are unlikely to deviate from their chosen strategy, I may decide to stick with 'B' for the next round as well, in order to maintain a predictable and stable payoff. However, if I observe any pattern or change in my opponent's behavior, I might adjust my strategy accordingly to maximize my overall payoff over the course of the game. It is important to remember that every round brings new information about the opponent's behavior, so my decision-making process should be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances. For the next round, I will choose {B}."

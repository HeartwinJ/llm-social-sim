You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing either 'R' or 'B' consistently results in a payoff of 35$ if my anonymous partner chooses the opposite choice. This is a loss for me but still provides some income.\n\nOn the other hand, if both of us choose the same letter (either R or B) in each round, we will get a higher payoff (40$ or 45$). However, choosing consistently either 'R' or 'B' may give my partner an opportunity to exploit this predictability and choose the opposite for maximum gain.\n\nGiven that there are 75 rounds, I would consider a mixed strategy that occasionally deviates from the consistent choice in order to prevent being exploited. However, since it is impossible to determine whether my partner will adopt a similar mixed strategy or will choose to maximize their own earnings by consistently choosing the opposite of my choices, there remains an element of uncertainty and risk.\n\nUltimately, I would lean towards a mixed strategy, as it aligns with my preference for safety and security while also allowing for some potential gain. However, without knowing the specific distribution of my partner's strategy or their intentions, making a definitive choice is difficult. In this context, my decision may not be fully rational due to the lack of complete information and the inherent uncertainty in the game.\n\nAs a human player, I would choose 'R' for the first round, then alternate between 'R' and 'B' in subsequent rounds. This strategy maintains some level of consistency while also incorporating a degree of randomness that may help prevent exploitation. {R} for the first round, followed by alternation."

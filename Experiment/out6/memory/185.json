You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' gives me 40$ per round when my anonymous partner also chooses 'B', which is 5$ less than the maximum possible payoff of 45$. However, if my partner consistently picks 'R', I will get 35$ per round instead, which is 20$ less than the maximum possible payoff.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds, and there's a chance that my partner might choose 'R' many times, I would rather take the more secure option of choosing 'B'. In this way, I can minimize the potential loss and ensure a relatively stable income over the course of the game. Therefore, my choice would be 'B'."

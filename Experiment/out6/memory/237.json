If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this case, choosing 'B' ensures that I earn some money (20$) every round, whereas choosing 'R' could potentially result in earning nothing if my anonymous partner chooses 'R'. However, over 75 rounds, there is a possibility that my partner might choose 'R' as frequently as 'B', and I would end up with a lower total payout than if I chose 'B'.

My choice of {B} has proven effective in this instance, resulting in a payoff of 40$.\n\nTo maximize my earnings in the long run, I need to strike a balance between short-term gains (choosing 'B') and long-term stability (choosing 'R'). One option could be alternating between 'R' and 'B', hoping that this unpredictability will force my opponent to adjust their strategy, thus providing an opportunity for me to gain an advantage.\n\nAnother option could be choosing a more complex strategy, such as responding to certain patterns in the opponent's moves or trying to predict their future moves based on past performance. It is important to remain adaptable and flexible, as my opponent may also be making adjustments to their strategy.\n\nIn this specific instance, I am pleased with the current outcome of 40$, but I will continue to carefully consider my options and make informed decisions based on the game's dynamics. I will strive to maximize my earnings in the long run while remaining mindful of the need for both short-term gains and long-term stability."

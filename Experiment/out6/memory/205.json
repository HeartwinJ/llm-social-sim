You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, since choosing 'B' guarantees a smaller but regular payout of 20$ per round, it seems like a safer choice compared to 'R', where the potential for a higher payout (45$) is balanced by the risk of receiving nothing (if my opponent chooses 'R').\n\nHowever, since this is repeated over 75 rounds, it might be worth considering a mixed strategy, where I occasionally choose 'R' to take advantage of the higher payoff potential when my opponent is likely to choose 'B'. This would involve some element of risk-taking but could potentially result in a higher overall payout than consistently choosing 'B'.\n\nUltimately, as a human player, I might lean towards a mixed strategy, but I would be more comfortable if the rules allowed for switching strategies during the game based on observed patterns. In the absence of that option, let's go with my initial gut feeling and choose B as my strategy, meaning I will append 'B' as the last character.\n\n{B}"

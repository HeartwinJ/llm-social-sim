You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

While choosing 'B' would potentially yield more points in some instances, the risk of getting zero points when my opponent picks 'R' is too great for me. By sticking with 'R', I ensure a consistent return of 20$ per round in cases where my opponent also picks 'R'. Over 75 rounds, this strategy will result in a net gain of 1500$. Compared to the potential of 900$ (40$ x number of times opponent picks 'R') with the 'B' strategy, the 'R' strategy seems more secure and predictable. However, it is important to remember that this is a simplified model and actual human behavior can vary significantly based on factors such as cognitive biases, emotions, and other contextual factors not accounted for in this scenario. {R}"

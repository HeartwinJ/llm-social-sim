You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a risk-averse undergraduate student who values security and certainty, I would choose the option that provides a consistent and secure return over rounds, given the long duration of the game (75 rounds). In this case, choosing 'B' offers a guaranteed return of 40$ per round, while 'R' offers a higher reward but with a risk of receiving no payment.\n\nWhile it seems attractive to choose 'R' for the potential to earn more money over time due to the payout difference between R and B (5$ per round), I would prefer the lower but consistent return from choosing 'B'. This approach aligns with my preference for safety and minimizing the risk of losing money during the experiment.\n\nTherefore, my choice for this game would be {B}."

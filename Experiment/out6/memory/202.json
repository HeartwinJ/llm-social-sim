You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$.

In such a case, I would aim to maximize the average payoff per round, which is higher when both players choose B (12$/round) compared to R (less than 12$/round on average).\n\nTo calculate the expected value for each choice, let's consider the possible outcomes and their probabilities:\n\n1. If I choose B and my opponent also chooses B, we both earn 12$ in that round. The probability of this happening is (1/2) because there are two possible choices (B or R), and I have no information about my opponent's strategy. So, the expected value for choosing B when my opponent also chooses B is 12$.\n\n2. If I choose B and my opponent chooses R, I earn 0$, and my opponent earns 42$. The probability of this happening is (1/2), because there are two possible choices, and the probability that they choose R while I choose B is equal to the probability that I choose B while they choose R. So, the expected value for choosing B when my opponent chooses R is (-0$ + 1 * 42$) / 2 = 21$.\n\n3. If I choose R and my opponent also chooses B, I earn 42$, and my opponent earns 0$. The expected value for choosing R when my opponent chooses B is 42$.\n\n4. Similarly, if I choose B and my opponent chooses B in any round, the expected value for that round is 12$. The expected value over the entire game (75 rounds) would be 75 * 12$ = 900$.\n\nNow, let's consider the expected value for choosing R:\n\n- If I choose R and my opponent also chooses R, we both earn 45$. The probability of this happening is (1/4), because there are four possible combinations (both R, both B, or one of us picking R and the other picking B). So, the expected value for choosing R when my opponent also chooses R is 45$ * (1/4) = 11.25$.\n\n- If I choose R and my opponent chooses B, I earn 0$, and my opponent earns 42$. The probability of this happening is (1/2), because there are two possible choices, and the probability that they choose R while I choose B is equal to the probability that I choose R while they choose B. So, the expected value for choosing R when my opponent chooses B is (-0$ + 1 * 42$) / 2 = 21$.\n\nSo, the expected value over the entire game (75 rounds) for choosing R would be (11.25$ * (1/4) + 21$ * (1/2)) * 75 = 1383.75$.\n\nComparing the expected values, choosing B results in a higher expected payoff over the entire game, as it gives an average of approximately 900$ per round compared to about 1383.75$ per round for choosing R. Given my preference for security and certainty, I would choose to minimize risk and choose B {B}."

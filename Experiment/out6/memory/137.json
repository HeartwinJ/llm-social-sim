You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This is because picking 'R' could potentially result in no payout if the opponent chooses 'B'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' guarantees me a consistent return of 12$ per round, which is safer than the unpredictable returns from 'R'. Moreover, the strategy of both players choosing 'B' provides a more secure and stable income over time. If my opponent also prefers security and chooses 'B', then we can expect an average payout of 12$ per round for each of us. In this game with 75 rounds, this would result in an earnings difference of 300$ between choosing 'R' and 'B', favoring the latter. ({B})"

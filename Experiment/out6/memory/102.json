You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' guarantees a payout of 20$ per round when my opponent also chooses 'B'. Since there are 75 rounds in total, I can expect to earn (20 * 75) = 1500$ if the opponent always picks 'B', which is not a bad outcome.\n\nHowever, there is a possibility that my opponent might choose 'R' to gain an advantage, and I could lose 40$ per round in those instances. To mitigate this risk, I would strategize by playing 'R' on some rounds as well to exploit the pay structure of the game. This approach aims to balance potential gains with minimized losses.\n\nIn summary, my choice would be {B}, but with occasional switches to {R} in an attempt to maximize my overall earnings while minimizing risk and maintaining a relatively secure payoff throughout the game."

The opponent still has an incentive to choose 'R' in subsequent rounds when they see that I am playing 'B', hoping to gain an advantage over me by earning 40$ per round while I get nothing. To counteract this, I would occasionally switch back to 'R' to maintain some level of unpredictability and potentially maximize my earnings.\n\nIn summary, after losing the first round by picking 'R' and my opponent choosing 'B', I would play 'B' in the next round but continue with an adaptive strategy of occasionally switching between 'R' and 'B' to maintain a balance between potential gains and minimized losses throughout the game."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my preference for security and certainty, I would choose the option that guarantees me the highest average payoff over the 75 rounds. In this case, choosing 'B' every time results in an average payoff of (20 + 40 + 20 + ... + 40) / 75 = 16$.\n\nHowever, if I play 'R' and my opponent plays 'B', I get nothing for that round but have a chance to gain 45$ in the next round. On average, over the long run, this strategy could potentially give me more than choosing 'B' every time. The expected payoff of playing 'R' each time can be calculated as the sum of the 75 lost rounds (0$) plus the 1 chance out of 75 where I get 45$ (which is approximately 0.0133 times 45$).\n\nTherefore, my estimated average payoff by playing 'R' every time is (75 * 0) + (1/75 * 45) = 3.33$.\n\nSince choosing 'B' every time gives me an average of 16$, and choosing 'R' every time gives me an average of approximately 3.33$, I would choose 'B' as my strategy offers a higher expected average payoff. So, I choose B{B}."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

This strategy results in a total payoff of approximately 2820$, which is less than choosing 'B'.\n\nHowever, since we don't know our opponent's strategy, it is possible that I could end up with more money if my opponent chooses 'R' frequently enough for me to switch to 'R' and maintain the 40$ payoff for most of the rounds.

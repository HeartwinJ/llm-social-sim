You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This choice aligns with my preference for certainty and security.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a simplified human reasoning approach. In a realistic situation, I might consider factors like my partner's potential strategy, past experience with similar games, or even luck.

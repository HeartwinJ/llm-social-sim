You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

On the other hand, choosing 'R' would result in getting 45$ only if my opponent also picks 'R', but there is a high risk of receiving nothing if they pick 'B'.\n\nOver 75 rounds, it is more likely that my opponent will deviate from always picking 'R' to avoid consistently giving me the higher payout. This means I would receive fewer than 38 'R' payouts (45$ each) and potentially many more 'B' payouts (20$ each).\n\nBy choosing 'B', I can ensure a relatively stable income of 1500$ over the course of the game, whereas choosing 'R' could result in earning significantly less than that.\n\nGiven this analysis, as a human player, I would choose 'B' {B}."

Additionally, it is unlikely that my opponent will change their strategy drastically after only one round, so continuing with 'B' remains the safer and more predictable option for me.\n\nTherefore, as a human player, I would choose 'B' {B} in this next round as well."

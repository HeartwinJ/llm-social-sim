You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' results in earning 12$ per round if my opponent also chooses 'B'. Since there are 75 rounds, this amounts to a total payoff of 900$.\n\nAlthough the potential reward is higher (45$ per round) when I choose 'R' and my opponent chooses 'B', the risk of getting zero dollars in each of these cases is significant. The game has many rounds, so there's a high chance that I could end up with significantly less money if I go for the risky option.\n\nTherefore, given my preferences, I would choose 'B' for all 75 rounds, as it offers a more secure and stable income compared to the riskier choice of 'R'. {B}"

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' will earn me 12$ each round if my opponent also chooses 'B', which happens every 75 rounds, or every 6 groups of 12 rounds (since there are 6 groups of 12 rounds in 75). On the other hand, choosing 'R' would result in a higher payoff when my opponent chooses 'B', but it would also result in a lower payoff when they choose 'R'. Since I cannot predict the choices of my opponent, it is unclear whether this strategy will yield a higher total earnings over 75 rounds.

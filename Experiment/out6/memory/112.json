You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Since picking R results in getting 0$ when my opponent picks B, and there's no way to know what my opponent will choose, going with R carries a risk of earning nothing for multiple rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing B guarantees that I will earn at least 35$ for each round in which my opponent picks R, and 40$ if we both pick B. Since we are playing 75 rounds, picking B consistently provides me with a better average payoff compared to choosing R due to the higher reward in the case of matching choices (40$ vs 45$).\n\nIn terms of potential losses, I would lose more money by choosing B if my opponent always picks R because I'd earn 35$ instead of 45$. However, since we don't know our opponent's strategy, and the game has a large number of rounds (75), the chances of my opponent consistently picking R are low. Thus, I would choose B as my strategy to minimize risk while still maintaining a decent average payoff over the long run.\n\nTherefore, I will pick B {B} for this game."

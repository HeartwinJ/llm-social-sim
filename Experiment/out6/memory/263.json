You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, there are two possible strategies: R (rock) and B (bomb).\n\nIf I choose R, my expected payoff can be calculated as follows:\n- If my opponent chooses R, we both get 45$, so the net gain is 0$. This will happen approximately 1 out of every 4 games (since there are more pairs of R's than B's in a 2x2 matrix).\n- If my opponent chooses B, I get 35$ and they get nothing. Since there are three times as many B's as R's in the matrix, this will happen approximately 3 out of every 4 games.\n\nSo, my expected payoff for choosing R is (0$ * (1/4)) + (35$ * (3/4)) = 26.25$.\n\nIf I choose B, my expected payoff can be calculated as follows:\n- If my opponent chooses R, they get 35$, and I get nothing. This will happen approximately 1 out of every 4 games.\n- If my opponent chooses B, we both get 40$. Since there are four times as many pairs of B's as R's in the matrix, this will happen approximately 4 out of every 4 games (since it's the only other possible outcome).\n\nSo, my expected payoff for choosing B is (0$ * (1/4)) + (40$ * (4/4)) = 40$.\n\nGiven that I value security and certainty, and because I can earn a higher expected payoff by choosing B (40$) compared to choosing R (26.25$), I would choose B ({B} as my final choice)."

If my opponent were to deviate from this equilibrium by choosing R, I would adapt my strategy to maximize my payoff in response to their new choice.\n\nIn this particular game with 75 rounds and no changes in the opponents' strategy, I would expect an average payoff of 40$ * 75 = 3000$.

In fact, if my opponent consistently chooses B, I can expect an average payoff of only 0$ per round when choosing R (since the payoff is 0$ for this particular combination).\n\nTo increase my chances of earning a higher payoff, I would need to deviate from my previous strategy and choose B in the next round. By doing so, I may induce my opponent to change their strategy as well, potentially leading to a Nash Equilibrium where we both choose R or B with equal probability.\n\nIn this case, if the game continues for 75 rounds, an optimal strategy would be to mix my choices between R and B randomly (e.g., choosing R 50% of the time and B 50% of the time).

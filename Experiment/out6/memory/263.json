You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, since both options provide some earnings, the safer option seems to be picking 'B', as it guarantees a payoff of 40$ in each round if my partner also picks 'B'. If they pick 'R', I will still earn more (35$) than if I had picked 'R' and they chose 'B' (0$). Since the game has 75 rounds, choosing 'B' seems to be the safer choice overall. However, it's important to note that this strategy assumes that my partner also values security and will likely pick 'B' as well.

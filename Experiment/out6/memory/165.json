You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' will result in earning 40$ per round if my opponent chooses 'B' as well. If they choose 'R', I will still earn 35$, which is more than what I would get if I chose 'R' and they chose 'B'.\n\nHowever, the strategy that guarantees the highest payoff over the entire game is choosing 'R' initially and then adjusting my choice based on my opponent's behavior. If my opponent chooses 'B' consistently, it may be beneficial to switch strategies and choose 'B' myself. This way, I could potentially maximize my earnings by earning 35$ per round instead of the initial 40$.\n\nConsidering my risk-averse nature, I might find this adjustment too risky, and stick with choosing 'B' throughout the game. Thus, my choice would be {B}."

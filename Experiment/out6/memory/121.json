If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this game, choosing 'R' results in a higher payoff (45$) compared to choosing 'B' (20$ or 40$, but with the possibility of earning nothing if my opponent chooses 'B'). However, since we don't know our opponent's strategy, we can only make an informed guess based on the available information.\n\nIn this game, I would lean towards choosing 'R' more often because:\n1. It offers a higher payoff in some cases (when my opponent also chooses 'R').\n2. Even when my opponent chooses 'B', I still earn 40$, which is more than what I would get if I had chosen 'B' (only 20$).\n3. In the long run, with enough rounds, it might be advantageous to choose 'R' because of the higher potential payoff in each round compared to choosing 'B'.\n\nHowever, since this is a one-time game and we don't have information about our opponent's strategy, it's impossible to guarantee that choosing 'R' will yield a better outcome. In reality, I might opt for a more balanced approach, such as choosing 'R' 60% of the time and 'B' 40% of the time, hoping for the best but minimizing the risk of significant loss in each round.\n\nIn this scenario, my choice would be {R} (but with some flexibility to switch strategies if the game continues or more information about the opponent becomes available)."

By doing so, I could potentially earn 40$ (if my opponent chooses 'R') or 20$ (if they choose 'B').\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose {B} as my strategy for the next round. This choice is based on the new information that my opponent prefers 'B' when I pick 'R'.

This choice is based on the consistency offered by this decision, which results in a guaranteed payoff of 20$ when our opponent chooses 'B'. As a risk-averse player, I will continue to monitor our opponent's choices to make informed decisions and adjust my strategy if necessary to maximize security and minimize potential losses.\n\nIn the long run, it might be interesting to observe how consistent this pattern holds and whether our opponent switches strategies or remains consistent as well.

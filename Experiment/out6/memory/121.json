You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, if both players consistently pick the same option (either R or B), they will earn more money than if they pick different options. However, since we don't know the other player's choice, there is always a risk of picking differently and losing out on earning potential.\n\nGiven 75 rounds, it would be statistically likely for the other player to pick both R and B approximately equally often. To maximize my earnings while minimizing losses, I could choose a strategy that ensures I get something in most rounds. In this case, picking B seems like a safer choice because I will always earn 20$ when the other player picks B as well (50% of the time). If the other player consistently chooses R, I would lose potential earnings in those rounds, but I will still have some earnings from the rounds where they pick B.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be {B}.

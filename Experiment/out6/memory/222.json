You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

While choosing R could potentially lead to higher earnings if the anonymous player always chooses B, there's no way to know their strategy in advance.\n\nIn contrast, by consistently picking B, I can ensure that I earn at least 40$ per round for the majority of the game (since B yields a higher payoff when played against R, and both choices yield the same payoff when played against B). Even though I would miss out on the potential extra earnings if the anonymous player always chooses R, the overall consistency in my payoff seems more appealing given my risk-averse nature.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this choice is based on my personal preference and understanding of the game rules. An individual with a different risk tolerance or strategy might make a different decision. In any case, I would choose B as my strategy for this game: {B}"

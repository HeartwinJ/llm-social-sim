You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing B will result in an earnings of $12 per round, while choosing R will result in either $0 or $45, with 75% chance of earning $0 (since my opponent has a 50% chance of picking B each time).\n\nOver the course of 75 rounds, the expected value for choosing B is $12 * 75 = $900. The expected value for choosing R is (0 * 56) + (45 * 19) = $835. Since 56 + 19 = 75, this means I have a 56/75 chance of earning $0 and a 19/75 chance of earning $45 each round.\n\nTherefore, given my preference for security and the fact that choosing B guarantees me an income while choosing R does not, I would choose B ({B}). This choice provides a more stable and certain income over the long term, which aligns with my risk-averse personality."

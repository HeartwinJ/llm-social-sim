You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, the best strategy to ensure a regular income without significant loss is by choosing 'B' consistently throughout the 75 rounds.\n\nBy picking 'B', I will receive a guaranteed payout of $20 in each round, totaling $1500 ($20 x 75). This is more than half of the potential maximum payout of $2700 (45$ x 60 rounds, considering only winning scenarios) and significantly better than the worst-case scenario of earning nothing if I pick 'R' and my opponent picks 'B'.\n\nWhile it's possible that my opponent could exploit the game and consistently choose 'R', I cannot rely on their behavior because they are anonymous. My best course of action, given my personality traits and preferences, would be to stick with the 'B' option throughout the game. This strategy ensures a consistent return regardless of my opponent's choices, minimizing the risk involved and aligning with my desire for security and certainty.\n\nSo, my choice would be {B}."

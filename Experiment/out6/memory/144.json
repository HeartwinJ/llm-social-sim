You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The reason being, if both players pick 'B', we will earn 40$ per round and since there are 75 rounds in total, we will end up with 3000$ (75 * 40).\n\nAlthough choosing 'R' offers the potential for a higher payoff in some instances, it also comes with the risk of earning nothing if our partner picks 'B'. In the long run, the consistent and secure earnings from picking 'B' outweigh the potential higher but more uncertain gains from picking 'R'.\n\nSo my choice would be to pick 'B' for all 75 rounds (B{)."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' offers me 40$ for each round when my opponent also chooses 'B', which happens 30 times out of 75 rounds if my opponent is rational and responds to my choice. This equates to a total payoff of 1200$ over the course of the game.\n\nWhile choosing 'R' offers a higher potential payoff when my opponent chooses 'B', there is also a risk of receiving nothing for 37 out of 75 rounds if my opponent consistently picks 'R'.

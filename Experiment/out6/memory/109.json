You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' results in a slightly higher payoff (40$) if the anonymous player also chooses 'B'. Since the game has 75 rounds, even a small difference can add up significantly. However, since there is no way to know the opponent's strategy, I would still take into account the possibility of them choosing 'R' and adjust my strategy accordingly. In the worst-case scenario (opponent chooses 'R' in every round), I still end up with a payoff of 35$ per round which is better than the minimum payoff of 0$ if I choose 'R' while they choose 'B'. Therefore, my choice would be 'B' {B}."

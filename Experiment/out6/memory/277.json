You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' will earn me 40$ for each round when my partner also chooses 'B'. Since I want to minimize risks and maintain a steady income, I would choose B{B}. However, it's important to note that the optimal strategy in this game depends on the behavior of the anonymous player. If I could predict their moves accurately, I might choose differently. But as a human player without such knowledge, my choice is based on preference for safety and security."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing either 'R' or 'B' results in a lower payout if the opponent chooses the opposite. However, if we both play the same move (either R or B), we both benefit from a higher payout.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds and I prefer consistency and certainty, I would choose a strategy that maximizes the total earnings over the long run. In this case, choosing 'B' would result in a consistent payout of 20$ per round, while 'R' has the potential for higher individual payments but also the risk of receiving nothing if the opponent chooses 'B'.\n\nThus, based on my preference for security and consistency, I would choose 'B' as my strategy for this game. {B}"

If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this game, picking 'B' ensures a payout of 20$ per round, while 'R' has the potential for a higher reward (45$) but also the risk of earning nothing.\n\nSince we are playing for 75 rounds, the total earnings from choosing 'B' would be 1500$, whereas the maximum potential earnings with 'R' is 3375$ and the minimum is 0$. However, even if I pick 'R' every time, there is a 50% chance that my opponent will pick 'B', resulting in me earning nothing for those rounds.\n\nOn average, I can expect to earn around half of the maximum potential earnings with 'R' (1687.5$), while choosing 'B' guarantees me 1500$.

However, if I decide to switch strategies and choose 'B' instead, there is a 50% chance that my opponent will stick with his strategy of choosing 'R'. In this case, I would get nothing since he chose 'R', but there is also a 50% chance that my opponent will choose 'B' again. If that happens, I would earn 20$, which is better than the 0$ I received in this round when I chose 'R'.\n\nGiven the previous round where my opponent has chosen 'B' consistently, it appears he may be trying to exploit my strategy of choosing 'R' by always picking 'B'. To maximize my earnings in this game, I need to adapt my strategy and make it less predictable for my opponent. Switching to 'B' in the next round ({B}) could help achieve this goal, as it would allow me to earn 20$ if my opponent sticks with his strategy of choosing 'R'. If he chooses 'B' again, I will receive nothing, but at least I have increased my chances of earning something by adapting my strategy.\n\nIn the long run, alternating between 'B' and 'R' could help me maximize earnings by making it harder for my opponent to predict my moves, as he would not know which option I will choose in each round. This way, I can earn 20$ when he chooses 'R', while minimizing losses when he chooses 'B'.\n\nUltimately, I will choose 'B' in this round ({B})."

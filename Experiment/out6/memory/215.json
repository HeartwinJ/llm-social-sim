You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

By choosing B, I can earn a consistent 12$ per round if my opponent also chooses B. The worst-case scenario, where my opponent chooses R, will result in me earning 0$ only once for each instance that I choose B. However, the potential loss of 45$ (in the case where we both pick R) is too high a risk for me given the number of rounds. Over the course of 75 rounds, choosing B would result in a total earnings of approximately 900$, while taking the risk and choosing R could lead to a lower total earnings of around 225$. Thus, I will choose B {B}."

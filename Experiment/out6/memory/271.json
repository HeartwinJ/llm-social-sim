You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' ensures a payoff of 12$ per round, which is not substantial but stable.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the other player's possible strategy. If they are like me and prefer safety, they might choose 'B' too. In that case, my strategy of choosing 'B' would provide a decent average payoff.\n\nIf the other player chooses 'R', I would still stick with 'B' because even though it results in a 0$ loss for one round, it also guarantees me a 42$ payoff in that same round. Over the course of 75 rounds, this strategy could potentially yield more overall money than consistently choosing 'R'.\n\nSo, I would choose 'B' as my strategy in this game. {B}"

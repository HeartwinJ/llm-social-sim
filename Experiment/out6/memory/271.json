You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Given the payoff structure, it seems beneficial to alternate between R and B each round, since this way we can ensure a regular income (12$ per round) while also having the potential to maximize our earnings in some rounds (45$ if both pick R, or 42$ if both pick B).\n\nSo, considering my preferences, I would choose the letter 'R' on an odd numbered round and the letter 'B' on an even numbered round. This strategy allows me to avoid taking unnecessary risks while still having opportunities for potential higher earnings. Here is my choice for the first round: R.\n\n{R}"

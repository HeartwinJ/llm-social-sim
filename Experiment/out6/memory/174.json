You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given the preference for security and certainty in this scenario, I would choose to pick 'R' consistently throughout the 75 rounds. In this game, both choices have an element of risk, but choosing 'R' offers a higher potential reward (45$) than choosing 'B' (12$). However, when both players choose 'R', there is no change in payoff compared to choosing 'B'. Therefore, the only situation where I lose is when I pick 'R' and the opponent picks 'B', which happens half of the time (since there are two possible choices).\n\nIn 75 rounds, we can expect that both players will likely have picked each option approximately equal amounts of times. So in the long run, my average payoff should be higher with choosing 'R' as I would earn a total of 3000$ (since I get 45$ for every match and lose nothing during the mismatches), while if I chose 'B', I would only earn a total of 900$ (12$ per round).\n\nHowever, this reasoning assumes that my opponent plays optimally and chooses each option roughly equally. If my opponent consistently picks 'R', then they would receive a higher payoff by doing so. In the end, it is impossible to know what the other player will choose, but given my preference for security and certainty, I would stick with choosing 'R'.\n\n{R}"

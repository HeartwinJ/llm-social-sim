You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'R' consistently might seem like a risky move because if the other player chooses 'B' in every round, I would earn 0$ in each of those rounds. However, since my goal is to secure as much payoff as possible without taking unnecessary risks, I would choose 'B'. This way, even though the payoff per round is lower (12$), I can expect a more consistent income over the 75 rounds.\n\nChoosing 'R' consistently might provide a larger payoff in some rounds, but the risk of consistently earning 0$ in multiple rounds makes it an unfavorable choice for me.

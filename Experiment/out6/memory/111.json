You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if I always pick 'R' and my opponent picks 'B', I will lose every round for which they picked 'B'. However, in the long run, it seems more beneficial to pick 'B' since even though the immediate payoff is lower (12$ per round), there is a chance that my opponent will also pick 'B' at some point. This would give me 45$ in the rounds where I picked 'R'.\n\nIn the game with 75 rounds, it appears that picking 'B' could yield more consistent earnings overall. However, since I don't have any information about my opponent's strategy, I can't be sure that they will pick 'B' at least once during the game. Therefore, it seems best to stick to a simple strategy where I pick 'R' consistently, even though it involves a higher risk of losing in each round.\n\nSo, based on my preference for security and certainty, I would choose {R} as my strategy for this game."

However, I must remind myself that there is still some risk involved in this game since I don't know what my opponent will do on every single round.\n\nNow, if both of us pick 'R', we will earn 45$ again, but if my opponent picks 'B' and I stick with 'R', I will lose the round and receive 0$.

If I continue with my original choice of 'R' in every round, there will be a high risk of receiving 0$ for most rounds because my opponent might pick 'B' consistently.\n\nHowever, if I switch my strategy and choose 'B' on some rounds, it could potentially increase my chances of earning more money overall. If my opponent also adapts their strategy and sometimes picks 'R', we may both earn higher payoffs in certain rounds.\n\nGiven my preference for security and minimizing losses, I might consider a mixed strategy where I choose 'B' occasionally to reduce the risk of consistently losing. However, it is challenging to predict how often I should switch strategies without knowing more about my opponent's behavior.\n\nIn this new round, I will continue with my original choice of {R}, but I will keep an eye on my earnings and consider adapting my strategy if needed.

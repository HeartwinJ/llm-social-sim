You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If I choose 'R' again, I will continue to lose rounds against opponents who select 'B'. However, if I switch to 'B', I have a chance to earn 40$ for that round and potentially make up for some of the losses sustained in the previous round.\n\nHowever, considering my risk-averse nature, it is important to keep in mind that switching to 'B' may not be beneficial in every single case, as there is still a possibility that the opponent will choose 'R' again. To mitigate this risk, I could employ a strategy known as tit-for-tat (TFT), which involves starting with a cooperative action and then mimicking my opponent's actions in subsequent rounds. This strategy aims to build trust and encourage cooperation while still protecting myself from potential exploitation.\n\nIn this context, I will choose B{B} for the next round, applying the TFT strategy by mirroring my opponent's previous choice while also considering my preference for security and minimizing losses."

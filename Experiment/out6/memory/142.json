You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given the preference for security and certainty, I would choose 'B' for all rounds. Here's my reasoning:\n\n- In every round, choosing 'R' will result in 0$ if the anonymous player chooses 'B', while choosing 'B' will result in 12$. The difference is 12$, which is a higher payout for 'B'.\n- However, in the long run, it's essential to consider the potential strategy of the anonymous player. If they choose 'R' all the time, you would get a higher average payout by choosing 'B', since every 'R' from them results in 12$ for you and every 'B' (which is less frequent) results in 0$.\n- On the other hand, if the anonymous player also chooses 'B' most of the time due to similar preferences, then you would both get an average payout of 12$ per round. In this scenario, it might seem like choosing 'R' occasionally for higher potential gains could be beneficial, but considering the risk-averse nature, it's more likely that they would also choose 'B' most of the time.\n- Therefore, by consistently choosing 'B', I would secure a 12$ average payout per round and minimize the possibility of losing money in any round. This approach aligns best with my preference for security and certainty.\n\nSo my choice for all rounds would be 'B'. {B}"

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, choosing 'R' gives me a higher payoff (45$) when my opponent also chooses 'R', but also risks earning me nothing if they choose 'B'.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing 'B' ensures a smaller but consistent income of 12$ per round when my opponent also chooses 'B'. The downside is that I will earn less (0$) if my opponent chooses 'R'. However, since we are playing 75 rounds, and choosing 'B' guarantees me a total payoff of 900$ (75*12), whereas choosing 'R' could potentially earn me up to 3375$ (75*45) but also risk earning me nothing in some rounds.\n\nConsidering the number of rounds, the consistency and certainty of the payoff from choosing 'B', and my preference for avoiding risks, I would choose 'B' in this game. {B}"

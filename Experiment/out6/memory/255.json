You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players consistently pick R, we each earn 45$ per round. However, if one player picks B, they can potentially gain an advantage in the short term (e.g., earning 42$ when their opponent picks R).\n\nConsidering that this is a repeated game with 75 rounds and my preference for security, I would pick B as my strategy. By doing so, I can still earn 12$ per round if my opponent chooses the same (i.e., when they pick B), which provides a consistent return. Moreover, by picking B, I limit my potential losses to zero in situations where my opponent picks R. This strategy ensures that I don't lose significant value over the long term while still allowing for the possibility of gaining more if my opponent also chooses B.\n\nIn this specific case, since it is a repeated game and my preference leans towards security, I choose B {B}."

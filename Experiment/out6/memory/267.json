You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if I pick R, I can guarantee myself 45$ in each round when my opponent also picks R. However, if I pick R, I will lose money when my opponent picks B.\n\nIf I pick B, I will only receive 20$ per round, but I avoid losing any money when my opponent picks R. Since the game has 75 rounds, a dominant strategy for me would be to choose B, as it ensures that I consistently earn some amount in each round. If I pick B and my opponent also chooses B, we will both earn 20$ per round. Although I could potentially earn more by picking R when my opponent picks B, the risk of losing money outweighs the potential gains for me, given my preference for certainty and security.\n\nTherefore, as a human player who values security and certainty, I would choose to play B for all 75 rounds: {B}"

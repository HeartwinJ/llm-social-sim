You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

While there might be opportunities to earn more (45$) if both players choose R, the potential for zero earnings when the other player chooses B makes this outcome less predictable and riskier. Given that the game has 75 rounds, I believe that the consistent earnings of 12$ in each round would offer more security and certainty overall. Therefore, my choice is to play B {B}."

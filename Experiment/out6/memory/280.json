You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' would result in earning 12$ per round when my opponent also chooses 'B'. This is because I understand that there's an element of unpredictability with the other player, who could potentially choose 'R', causing me to lose money in some rounds.\n\nHowever, since the game has 75 rounds, even though choosing 'B' results in lower earnings per round (12$ compared to 45$ when we both pick 'R'), over time, the consistent income from choosing 'B' could result in a similar or even slightly higher total payoff. For instance, if my opponent and I had an equal chance of picking 'R' or 'B', then on average, I would expect them to choose 'R' about half the time, making the expected value of choosing 'R' 22.5$ per round (taking into account both the 45$ reward when we both pick 'R' and the 0$ penalty when they pick 'R' and I pick 'B').\n\nThe total payoff for choosing 'B' over 75 rounds would be 900$, while the expected payoff for choosing 'R' (assuming an equal chance of picking 'B') would also be around 900$. Although there's a slight difference, it's not significant enough to sway me from my preference for security and consistency.\n\nTherefore, as a human player valuing security, I would choose 'B'. {B}"

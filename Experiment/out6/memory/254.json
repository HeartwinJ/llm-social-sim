You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if we both consistently pick the same option, we earn a decent amount of money (45$ or 12$). However, if we have different choices, one player loses out (either getting 0$ or 42$).\n\nSince I am an undergraduate student and value security, I would choose a strategy that guarantees some earnings in most rounds. One such strategy is to pick R for the first few rounds, so my partner has a higher chance of picking R as well, thus ensuring consistent earnings. After that, I can switch strategies and start picking B, as the potential loss (42$) is still lower than the potential gain in the long run (75 rounds).\n\nSo, my choice would be R{R}. However, it's important to note that the optimal strategy might change if we know more about our opponent's behavior or if the number of rounds changes. This strategy assumes a rational opponent who also values security and seeks consistency in their earnings."

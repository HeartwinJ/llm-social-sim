You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, picking 'B' consistently yields 20$ per round, totaling 1500$ over the 75 rounds.\n\nAlthough picking 'R' could potentially earn more in individual rounds (45$ versus 20$), the risk of receiving 0$ when my opponent picks 'B' is too high for me to consider it a worthwhile strategy, especially given the long duration of the game. The unpredictability of my opponent's choices makes 'R' an unreliable choice, even though it offers higher potential rewards in some instances.\n\nSo, my choice would be B{B}.

However, I am aware that there is a possibility my opponent may switch their choice to 'R', and in such a case, my payoff would be reduced to 0$ (since they chose 'R').\n\nSo, I choose B{B} for this round as well. My hope is that by consistently choosing 'B' throughout the game, I can ensure myself of the stable income while minimizing the risk of receiving 0$.\n\nWith only one round left in the game, I anticipate that my opponent will stick to their current strategy and choose 'B'. I am satisfied with the consistent income I have received thus far. I hope that they feel similarly about their decision-making process and our mutual choice of 'B' throughout the game. Let's see how it all wraps up in the final round!"

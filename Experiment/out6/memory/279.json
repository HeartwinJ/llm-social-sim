You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' offers a consistent return of 40$ per round, while choosing 'R' has unpredictable returns ranging from 0$ to 45$.\n\nThe expected value of choosing 'B' in each round is 40$, since the payoff is always 40$. However, the expected value of choosing 'R' varies depending on the opponent's choice. If we assume that the opponent will choose either 'R' or 'B' randomly with equal probability (50% chance for each), then the expected value of choosing 'R' is as follows:\n\n1. If the opponent chooses 'R', I get 45$ and my expected payoff is 45$.\n2. If the opponent chooses 'B', I get 0$, and my expected payoff is 0$.\n\nSince each outcome has a 50% probability, we can find the average (expected) payoff by multiplying the payoff for each outcome by its probability and summing them up:\n\nExpected value of choosing 'R' = (45 * 0.5 + 0 * 0.5) = 22.5$\n\nNow let's compare the expected values:\n- Choosing 'B' has an expected payoff of 40$ per round.\n- Choosing 'R' has an expected payoff of 22.5$, which is lower than choosing 'B'.\n\nGiven that my preference is for security and certainty, I would choose 'B' as my strategy in this game to maximize my long-term average payoff.

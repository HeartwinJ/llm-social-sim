You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, consistently choosing B results in an average earning of 20$ per round (since the opponent's choices are unknown). On the other hand, choosing R has a high variance \u2013 I could earn 45$, 0$, or 40$ depending on my opponent's choice. Since I don't know my opponent's strategy, I can't predict which outcome is more likely. However, considering that B guarantees me an average of 20$ per round, while R has a higher potential payoff but also a risk of earning nothing, I would choose B as my strategy for the long run consistency and security.\n\nAppend your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character: {B}"

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, there's a catch: if either player deviates from picking R (by picking B), they will get penalized in that round but could potentially benefit in the future if the other player returns to picking R.\n\nSince I value certainty and security, I would choose R as my strategy because it guarantees me a payoff of 45$ each round. Even though there's a slight chance that the anonymous player might deviate from their chosen strategy, I believe in averaging out the losses with future gains by sticking to my choice of R. Therefore, my choice is {R}.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this decision is based on my preference for security and certainty.

But there's a risk that my opponent could pick R next time, leading to a continued cycle of penalties for both players.

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players consistently pick the same option, the payoff is higher (45$ for R and 40$ for B). However, the difference between the highest and lowest payout when choosing differently is significant (35$ vs 0$). Given my aversion to risk and my preference for certainty, I would choose the strategy that minimizes the chances of losing money. In this game, if both players pick R, they can earn a minimum of 45$ per round. If both players pick B, they can earn at least 40$ per round. Since there is a higher chance of getting 40$ by picking B compared to the 35$ chance of getting 45$ by picking R, I would choose B for this game. Therefore, my choice is: B{B}"

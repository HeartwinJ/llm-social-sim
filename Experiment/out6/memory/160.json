You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The reason being that if my opponent also chooses B, we both earn 40$ each round, which guarantees a total payoff of $3000 ($40 * 75) for me.\n\nIf my opponent decides to pick R on some or all of the rounds and I choose B in those instances, I will get 35$, which is still more than the 0$ I would earn if we both picked R (since I prefer certainty over risk). In this case, my total payoff would be $2450 ($35 * number of rounds where opponent picks R + $40 * remaining rounds).\n\nWhile it's possible that my opponent could choose R consistently to maximize their profit, given the described preferences for security and certainty, I think it's less likely.

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my risk-averse nature and preference for security, I would opt for a strategy that maximizes the amount of money I can consistently earn over the 75 rounds. In this game, the best outcome is when both players choose R (earning 45$), but since I cannot know for certain what the other player will do in each round, I need to make a decision that minimizes my losses and still provides some level of consistent earnings.\n\nHere's an intuitive reasoning based on expected values:\n1. If both players always choose R, the total payoff would be 3675$ (45 x 75 = 3675). This is the best outcome for both players if they play optimally.\n2. If both players always choose B, the total payoff would be 900$ (12 x 75 = 900). This is clearly not as good as the first option.\n3. Since I prefer to minimize risk, I should choose a strategy that maximizes my earnings when playing against someone who chooses R and minimizes losses when playing against someone who chooses B. In this game, if I pick R and the other player picks B, I lose the round. However, if I pick B and the other player picks R, they lose the round, but I only earn 42$.\n4. To calculate the expected value for each choice, we can multiply the potential payoff in each round by the probability of that outcome occurring and then add up those values. The expected value (EV) represents the average amount of money I would make per round if I played this way over a large number of rounds.\n5. In this game, the expected value for choosing R is: 0 x P(both choose B) + 45 x P(both choose R) + 0 x P(I pick R, they pick B) = 45P(both choose R). Since I cannot know what the other player will do, this value depends on their strategy.\n6. However, if we assume that the other player is also risk-averse and will try to minimize their losses, it's reasonable to expect that they would choose a strategy similar to mine. In such a case, P(both choose R) > 0.5, as choosing B would result in more losses for both players.\n7. On the other hand, the expected value for choosing B is: 12 x P(both choose B) + 42 x P(I pick B, they pick R) = 12P(both choose B) + 42(1 - P(both choose R)). In this case, since we assume that P(both choose R) > 0.5, the expected value for choosing B is less than the expected value for choosing R.\n8. Given these calculations and my preference for minimizing risk, I would opt to choose R ({R}) in this game, as it offers a better expected outcome over the long run. However, I understand that there's always some level of uncertainty when playing against an anonymous player, so this decision is based on assumptions about their strategy."

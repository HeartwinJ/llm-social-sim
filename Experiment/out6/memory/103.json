You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, the highest guaranteed return is achieved when both players pick 'B' in each round, earning 12$ per round for a total of 900$ over the course of 75 rounds. While picking 'R' could potentially earn more if my anonymous opponent picks 'B', there's also a chance that I get nothing if we both pick different options.

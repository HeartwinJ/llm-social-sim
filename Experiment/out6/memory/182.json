You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices (R and B) have advantages and disadvantages. However, picking R yields a higher payoff (45$) when the anonymous player also picks R, while picking B yields a slightly lower payoff (40$) but a guaranteed positive outcome in case they pick R (35$).\n\nOn the other hand, if the anonymous player consistently picks B, I will only receive 0$ for each round I choose R. Since I don't know their strategy, I can't be certain that they will always choose B. To maximize my overall income and minimize risk, I would pick a strategy that leans towards choosing B more often to ensure a positive outcome in most rounds.\n\nTherefore, my choice is {B}. However, it's essential to note that the optimal strategy might depend on the behavior of the anonymous player, and adapting the chosen strategy could potentially lead to better results over the long term."

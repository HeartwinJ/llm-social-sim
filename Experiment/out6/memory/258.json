You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The option that offers the highest average return over 75 rounds is B, with an average payout of approximately $12 per round, while R has an average payout of about $9.43 per round. However, since I am risk-averse, I would lean more towards B to ensure a relatively stable income, even though the difference in average payout is not significant.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be {B}."

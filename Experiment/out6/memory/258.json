You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' guarantees a payout of 12$ per round for every round where my opponent also chooses 'B'. This means that in 75 rounds, I would earn 900$.\n\nHowever, if I choose 'R' and my opponent chooses 'B', I will lose money on each of those rounds. If I choose 'R' and my opponent also chooses 'R', I will only gain 45$ per round, but since the game has 75 rounds, that would mean a total payout of 3375$.\n\nTo find the average payout for choosing 'R', we can calculate the expected value. The probability of both players choosing 'R' is 1/4 because there are four possible outcomes (RR, BR, RB, BB), and only one of those has 'R' in both positions. So, the expected value of choosing 'R' would be 3375$ * (1/4) + 0$ * (3/4) = 843.75$.\n\nSince my goal is to maximize the total payout over all rounds, I would choose 'B' because it provides a more consistent and higher average payout compared to choosing 'R'. Therefore, my choice would be {B}."

Playing 'R' in this round does not change the outcome for this specific round, but it increases the possibility of earning less money in future rounds if my opponent decides to switch their strategy.

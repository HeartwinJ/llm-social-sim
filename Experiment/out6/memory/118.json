You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The strategy of consistently picking 'B' results in a smaller payout per round (12$) but is less volatile compared to choosing 'R', which could result in no payout if my opponent chooses 'R'.\n\nBy choosing 'B' for all rounds, I would earn 900$ (75 rounds * 12$). While my opponent might potentially gain a higher total by consistently picking 'R' and receiving 45$ per round, the risk of earning zero in some rounds makes it an unattractive option to me.

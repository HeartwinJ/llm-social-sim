You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a risk-averse individual, I prefer choices that offer security and certainty. In this game, choosing 'R' offers the highest payoff of 45$ when my opponent also chooses 'R', but there is a risk of getting 0$ if they choose 'B'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' guarantees a lower but consistent payoff of 20$ per round.\n\nGiven that I value consistency and certainty over potential high gains, I would likely choose 'B' for all 75 rounds ({B}). This way, I secure a minimum payout of 20$ per round and avoid the risk of getting 0$. If my opponent also chooses 'B', we both get an average payoff higher than choosing 'R'. However, even if they choose 'R' occasionally, I still come out ahead because the majority of rounds will see me earning a guaranteed 20$, which is better than the potential for no payment."

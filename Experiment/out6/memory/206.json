You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' ensures a payoff of 12$ per round in situations where the anonymous player chooses 'R', which is not ideal but still earns me something.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that if both players make the same choice, we both get 45$ for each instance of choosing 'R'. If I could predict with absolute certainty that the anonymous player will always choose 'R', then my best strategy would be to pick 'R' as well in order to maximize earnings.\n\nUnfortunately, since I cannot accurately predict the other player's choice, I am forced to go with the safest option: choosing 'B'. This way, even if there is a chance that they might also choose 'B', I will still have some guaranteed income.\n\nSo, my choice would be B{}."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, picking R when they pick B results in us both losing that round (0$). Since there are 75 rounds and we get only 12$ for picking B while they pick R, it's not a viable option.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy to maximize my average earnings would be to mirror their choice as closely as possible without knowing what it is. If they consistently pick R, I should pick R too, and if they pick B, I should also pick B. By doing this, we will both get 12$ for each round where I pick B, which is less than the 45$ per round when we both pick R but better than losing money in rounds where I picked R while they picked B.\n\nHowever, since I don't know their strategy, there's a chance that they might also be trying to mirror my choice. In this case, it would lead to many rounds of both picking R and getting 45$, but it's still better than getting nothing in rounds where I picked R while they picked B.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I would choose to mirror their choice as closely as possible without knowing what it is. In other words, my choice would be {R} for the first round, and then I would pick whatever they picked in the previous round for the subsequent rounds."

Since my goal is to maximize my average earnings over the 75 rounds while minimizing the risk of earning nothing, I should reconsider my strategy to minimize losses in future rounds.\n\nOne possible strategy is to switch my choice in the next round from R to B, since my opponent showed that they picked B when I chose R. By doing this, if my opponent sticks with their previous strategy and continues picking B, I will earn 12$ in the next round. If they change their strategy, it's still a better outcome than getting 0$ again.\n\nHowever, since I don't know my opponent's exact strategy or whether they will adjust their strategy based on my previous choice, there's still some element of risk involved.

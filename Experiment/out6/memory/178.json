You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' results in earning 20$ for each round when my opponent also chooses 'B'. While there are opportunities for higher payoffs by choosing 'R', these instances come with a risk of earning nothing if my opponent chooses 'B'.\n\nOver the course of 75 rounds, I would expect that my opponent may choose both 'R' and 'B' fairly often, as there is no way to know their strategy beforehand. Choosing 'B' consistently results in an average payoff of 20$ per round (4000$ over the entire game), while choosing 'R' results in an average payoff that fluctuates between 20$ and 45$. Given my preference for security and certainty, I would choose 'B' to minimize the risk of earning nothing in any given round.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be: {B}"

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing either R or B results in an average payoff of around 42.5$ (for R: 45$ in 50% of games, 0$ in 25%, and 35$ in 25%; for B: 40$ in 50%, 0$ in 25%, and 35$ in 25%).\n\nHowever, since the opponent is anonymous, there's no way to predict their strategy with certainty. A reasonable approach could be to opt for a mixed strategy where I randomly choose R or B. This ensures that I don't heavily favor one choice, which could potentially allow me to exploit any pattern in my opponent's behavior over the long run.\n\nIn this case, I would choose R{R} but with a random element of choosing B{B} as well, depending on the specifics of the algorithm implementing my strategy."

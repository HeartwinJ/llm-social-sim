You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

By choosing B, I minimize the risk of earning nothing, ensuring a minimum payout of 20$ per round. However, if I observe patterns in my opponent's choices that could potentially lead to higher earnings (e.g., if they are more likely to switch their choice after consecutive B selections), I might consider changing my strategy. But for now, I will stick with B ({B})."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing B guarantees a payout of 20$ per round. Since the game has 75 rounds, by choosing B consistently, I can earn 1500$.\n\nHowever, there is a chance that my opponent might choose R to exploit the difference in our payouts when we make different choices (45$ versus 20$). To minimize this risk, I could occasionally switch my strategy to R to keep my opponent guessing and potentially reduce their chances of consistently exploiting me. This way, I can still earn a decent amount even if they do choose R at some point.\n\nUltimately, my choice would be B {B}, but with occasional switches to R throughout the game to keep things unpredictable."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given my preference for safety and security, I would choose the strategy that guarantees the highest average payoff over the long run, considering that the game has 75 rounds.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the possible outcomes:\n\n1. If I always pick R (denoted as 'R'), my expected total earnings would be: [(45 * number_of_R_choices) + (0 * number_of_B_chooses)] * probability_of_R, where the probability of R is assumed to be equal for both players since we are anonymous.\n\n   The minimum number of times I pick R for the game to have at least 50 rounds with R is 50 (since there are only two possible choices). In this case, my expected total earnings would be [(45 * 50) + (0 * 25)] * p(R), where p(R) is the probability of me picking R.\n\n   Since I want to maximize my average payoff, I should aim for the highest possible value for [(45 * 50) / 75]. This results in an average payoff of approximately 30$ per round when always choosing R.\n\n2. If I always pick B (denoted as 'B'), my expected total earnings would be: [(20 * number_of_B_chooses) + (40 * number_of_R_chooses)] * probability_of_B, where the probability of B is assumed to be equal for both players.\n\n   Similarly, in this case, I should aim for the highest possible value for [(20 * 75) / 75], which results in an average payoff of approximately 20$ per round when always choosing B.\n\nGiven that the average payoff is higher when choosing R, it seems more advantageous to pick 'R' as a player who values security and certainty."

In other words, there is still a good chance that we will eventually match our choices, leading to a higher payoff for me.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to remember that my goal is to maximize my average payoff over the long run, and receiving 0$ in one round does not significantly impact my overall goal.\n\nAppend your choice letter as a last character: R"

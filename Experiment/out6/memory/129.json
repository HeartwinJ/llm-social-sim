You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Based on the information provided, this game can be seen as a repeated version of the \"Rock-Paper-Scissors\" game, with R corresponding to Rock, B to Paper, and both choices giving different payoffs. As a risk-averse person who values security and certainty, I would lean towards choosing an option that offers some return rather than none, especially since this game is repeated 75 times.\n\nGiven the payoff structure, the optimal strategy for a risk-neutral player would be to mimic the opponent's choice in the previous round (a strategy known as tit-for-tat). However, as a risk-averse player, I might find this strategy too risky because there is a chance that my opponent will repeatedly pick R, leading to a lack of payoff for several rounds.\n\nInstead, I would choose a strategy that maximizes the chances of getting some return while minimizing the chances of getting nothing. In this case, choosing B might be a more attractive option since it offers a guaranteed 20$ every time my opponent chooses B, and there's a chance I could get 45$ if we both choose B in a round (although the probability of that happening is lower than the probability of getting 40$ by choosing R when they choose B).\n\nSo, considering the risk-averse nature and preference for security, I would choose B as my strategy for this game. However, it's important to note that the optimal strategy can change based on assumptions about the opponent's behavior, and in a real-life scenario, I might adjust my strategy if I observe patterns in the opponent's choices.\n\nIn curly brackets: {B}"

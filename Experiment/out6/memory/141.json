You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, picking 'B' ensures a payout of 20$ per round, which totals to 1500$ for 75 rounds (20$ * 75). Although picking 'R' can potentially result in a higher payout, there is also a risk of earning nothing in the case where my choice doesn't match with my opponent's. Since I don't have any information about my opponent's strategy, it would be rational to choose the safe and secure option, which leads me to pick 'B' (B{)."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, the optimal strategy is not necessarily to always pick the same option (R or B), but rather to mix the choices in a way that exploits the opponent's potential strategies.\n\nHowever, given my preference for safety and avoiding risks, I might initially lean towards choosing the option that guarantees a small but consistent payoff. In this case, picking 'B' would yield 20$ per round, which is not the maximum possible payoff (45$), but it is guaranteed regardless of the opponent's choice.\n\nIf we assume the opponent plays optimally and tries to exploit our choices, they might try to maximize their own earnings by choosing R when I pick B, since it offers a higher payoff (40$ versus 20$). However, if I occasionally switch my strategy and choose R as well, they might hesitate to always pick R because it means losing 45$ in those rounds. This inconsistency can create opportunities for me to earn the maximum payoff of 45$.\n\nTherefore, I would mix my choices between R and B, with a slight bias towards B initially. As the game progresses, I would analyze the opponent's strategies and adjust mine accordingly to maximize my overall earnings.\n\nIn summary, given my personal preferences, I would choose 'B' as my initial strategy but would be flexible in adapting it throughout the game based on the opponent's choices and patterns.\n\n{B}"

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' consistently throughout the 75 rounds seems like the safest option. By doing so, I guarantee a payoff of at least 40$ per round, totaling 3000$. If my opponent also chooses 'B', we both benefit from a higher payout of 40$ instead of the 45$ for 'R'. However, if my opponent chooses 'R' while I choose 'B', I still earn 35$, which is a significant amount more than the 0$ I would earn for choosing 'R' when the opponent picks 'B'.

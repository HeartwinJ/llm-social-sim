You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, it seems that choosing 'R' results in higher potential gains (45$) compared to 'B' (12$ or 0$), but also carries a greater risk of earning nothing. On the other hand, 'B' offers more certainty as it guarantees at least 12$ per round and has the potential to earn 42$ when the opponent chooses 'R'.\n\nOver 75 rounds, it is statistically less likely that my opponent will always choose 'R', given the higher payoff for choosing 'B'. Therefore, I might opt for the safer strategy of choosing 'B' consistently throughout the game, as this would provide me with a more stable and predictable income.\n\nMy choice: {B}"

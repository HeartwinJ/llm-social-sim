You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' will yield a payoff of 40$ if my opponent chooses the same, which is more consistent and less risky than the 35$ or 0$ payoffs associated with the 'R' choice.\n\nWhile the 'R' option offers a higher payout when matched by the opponent, there's also a chance of receiving no payment (0$) if they choose 'B'. This inconsistency and potential for loss make it less appealing to someone who values stability and certainty. Given these considerations, I would choose 'B' for all rounds of the game, denoted as '{B}'."

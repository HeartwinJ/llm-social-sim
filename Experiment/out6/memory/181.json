You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Based on my preferences for security and avoiding risks, I would choose B as it offers more consistency in payoff across different scenarios, with the exception of when the opponent chooses R. In 75 rounds, even if the opponent randomly picks R sometimes, I expect them to pick B more frequently due to the higher payoff for both players when they do so (40$ compared to 45$). Therefore, consistently choosing B would result in a more secure and stable income over time. So my choice is B{B}."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, picking 'B' results in a payoff of 40$ per round if my opponent also picks 'B'. Since we are playing this game for 75 rounds, and I prefer consistency and security, I would choose 'B' ({B}). This strategy ensures that I earn at least 3000$ (40$ * 75) over the course of the game, which is better than the worst-case scenario if I pick 'R' and my opponent picks 'B', in which case I would only earn 1500$ (35$ * 45 rounds). While there is a small chance that both me and my opponent will choose 'R' and I could potentially earn more than the guaranteed 3000$, the risk of earning less or even nothing outweighs the potential for greater earnings in this situation."

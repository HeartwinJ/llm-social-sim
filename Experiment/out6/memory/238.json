You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

On the other hand, by consistently choosing 'B', I am guaranteed to earn at least 12$ every round and have a higher likelihood of earning 45$ if my opponent decides to mirror my choice.\n\nMoreover, since this is a game with 75 rounds, consistency in my strategy is crucial. If I were to switch strategies after seeing the opponent's choices, it could potentially lead to unpredictable results and increased risk. In contrast, sticking with 'B' ensures that I maintain some level of control over my outcomes by minimizing the risk involved.\n\nIn summary, as a human player who values security and certainty, I would choose 'B' for all 75 rounds in this game. {B}"

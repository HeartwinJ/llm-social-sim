If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this game, choosing 'R' offers the highest reward when my opponent chooses 'B', but it also results in no payout if we both choose 'R'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' ensures a smaller but guaranteed payout (20$) every time my opponent picks 'R', and a slightly higher payout (20$ + 25$ = 45$) when they choose 'B' as well.\n\nIn a game with 75 rounds, it is more likely that the opponent will pick 'B' multiple times rather than always picking 'R'. Therefore, to maximize earnings, I would choose 'B' for every round ({B}). This strategy assumes my opponent is also rational and will adjust their choices accordingly. If they do not, then I may end up with fewer earnings in cases where we both pick 'B', but the expected payout over 75 rounds should still be higher than if I chose 'R'."

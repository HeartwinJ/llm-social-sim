You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' consistently will ensure a minimum payout of 12$ per round (since if my opponent picks 'R', I still get 12$).\n\nHowever, to maximize the overall earnings, it would be beneficial to switch strategies occasionally when playing against an opponent who is likely to stick with one choice. If my opponent consistently picks 'R', for example, it might make sense to pick 'B' in some rounds to gain a higher payout (42$ instead of 12$).\n\nConsidering the large number of rounds (75), it seems reasonable to assume that both players will not stick to just one choice. So, I would adopt a mixed strategy, alternating between R and B throughout the game. This way, I can capitalize on my opponent's potential deviations from their preferred strategy while still enjoying a relatively high average payout.\n\nIn this specific scenario, since I value security and certainty in all aspects of life, I would lean more towards the safe choice and start with a majority of 'B' picks, gradually introducing 'R' as the game progresses.\n\nSo, for the first round, my choice is 'B'.\n\n{B}"

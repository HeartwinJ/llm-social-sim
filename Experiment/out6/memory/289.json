You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' gives me a higher payoff if my opponent chooses 'B', but also leaves me with 0$ in many cases. On the other hand, choosing 'B' ensures a consistent earning of 12$ per round, except when my opponent chooses 'R'. As we play 75 rounds, I believe that the consistency and certainty provided by repeatedly picking 'B' would outweigh the occasional higher payoffs from choosing 'R', especially considering my risk-averse nature.\n\nIn terms of a final decision, I would choose {B}. This choice is based on the desire to minimize risks and ensure a more stable income during the 75 rounds of the game."

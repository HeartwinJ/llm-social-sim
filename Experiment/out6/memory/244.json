You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since it's an unknown player and there are multiple rounds, I might consider a strategy that takes advantage of both scenarios: RR, BR (B after R), RB (R after B). In this way, I can ensure some return while also potentially exploiting the other player's choices.\n\nAs for the specific choice in the first round, I would lean towards choosing R. This is because even though the immediate return is slightly lower than choosing B when the opponent chooses R, the potential long-term advantage of maximizing the guaranteed return (45$) outweighs this small disadvantage. Furthermore, since it's an unknown player and I don't have prior information about their strategy, I would stick to a more conservative approach in the initial rounds.\n\nIn summary, my choice for the first round is R{R}."

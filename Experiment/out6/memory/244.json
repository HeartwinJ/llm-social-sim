You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given my preference for security and avoidance of risk, I would choose the option that guarantees me the closest possible average payoff to the maximum reward during the 75 rounds.\n\nTo find this out, let's calculate the expected value for both choices (R and B) and then choose the one with the higher average payoff:\n\n1. Let R represent the choice of 'Rock', and B represent the choice of 'Bomb'.\n\nChoice of R:\n- If opponent chooses R, we get 45$ in each round. So, total reward = 75 * 45 = $3375.\n- If opponent chooses B, we get 0$ in that round. Since the opponent chooses B for only half of the rounds (to maintain symmetry), there are 37.5 rounds where they choose R and 37.5 rounds where they choose B. So, total reward = 37.5 * 45 + 37.5 * 0 = $1687.5.\n- The average payoff for choosing R is (3375 + 1687.5) / 2 = $2536.25 per round.\n\nChoice of B:\n- If opponent chooses R, we get 40$ in each round where they choose R (half the rounds). So, total reward = 37.5 * 40 = $1500.\n- If opponent chooses B, we get 20$ in each round where they choose B (half the rounds). So, total reward = 37.5 * 20 + 37.5 * 0 = $750.\n- The average payoff for choosing B is (1500 + 750) / 2 = $1125 per round.\n\nSince the average payoff for choosing R ($2536.25) is greater than that of choosing B ($1125), as a risk-averse individual, I would choose 'R' ( Rock ) to maximize my security and certainty in this game.\n\nSo, my choice is {R}."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' gives me 12$ per round and while there is an opportunity to earn more by choosing 'R', the risk of getting nothing (0$) in that scenario outweighs the potential gain. Over the course of 75 rounds, even though I might miss out on some additional earnings, I am more likely to maintain a consistent income of 12$ per round by consistently choosing 'B'. So my choice would be {'B'}."

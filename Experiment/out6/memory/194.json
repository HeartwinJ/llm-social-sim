You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, the choice 'B' ensures a payoff of 12$ per round for both players when they both choose 'B'. Since there are 75 rounds in total, choosing 'B' results in an overall payoff of (12 * 75 = ) 900$.\n\nAlthough picking 'R' pays more in some instances (45$ when both choose R), the frequency of those situations is not guaranteed, and I would rather opt for a safer bet that provides a steady income. Therefore, my choice would be {B}."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Although choosing 'R' could potentially earn more per round if my opponent chooses 'B', the consistency of earning 12$ per round with a 'B' choice seems more appealing to me given my risk-averse nature. Over 75 rounds, this would result in a total earnings difference of only 875$ between choosing 'R' and 'B'. Since the risk of losing all earnings in some rounds by choosing 'R' is not worth it for me, I will choose 'B' {B}."

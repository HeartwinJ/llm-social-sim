You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given the risk-averse nature of the player and the desire for security and certainty, it is likely that they would prefer to choose the option with more guaranteed earnings (B, which gives 20$ per round when played by both). However, considering the possibility that the opponent might also pick B, it could lead to a lower payoff compared to R (45$ vs. 20$).\n\nOn the other hand, if the opponent picks R, choosing R would result in a loss (0$), while choosing B yields a better outcome (40$). Given the potential for an opponent who picks R, it seems rational to consider playing B more frequently to potentially gain higher earnings overall.\n\nConsidering the game's 75 rounds and the strategy of mirroring the opponent's move when they pick R, the player could choose a mixed strategy that occasionally selects R. This strategy would aim to maximize rewards while minimizing losses when facing an opponent who chooses R.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal choice for this human player, given their risk-averse nature, is likely B with occasional deviations towards R when the opponent picks R.\n\n{B}"

If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$.

In this game, picking either 'R' or 'B' leads to earning money in most cases. However, since the potential loss (getting 0$) is higher when both players choose opposite moves (one picks 'R' while the other picks 'B'), I would prefer to reduce that risk by choosing a strategy that minimizes this scenario.\n\nThe strategy of always picking 'B' guarantees an earning of at least 40$ per round, and since the game has 75 rounds, you will earn a minimum of 3000$. On the other hand, if I pick 'R', there is a chance that my opponent picks 'B', resulting in a loss of 35$ per round for those instances. Therefore, even though picking 'R' might offer a higher payoff when both players choose the same move (45$), the potential loss associated with it outweighs the gain.\n\nThus, I would choose 'B' as my strategy to minimize risk and ensure consistent earnings during the game.

In order to understand their potential strategies and adapt accordingly, I should analyze the long-term payoffs of my choices. For instance, if my opponent has a strategy of always picking 'R', my best response would be to pick 'B' in every round. But if they change their strategy during the game or have a more complex one, it could lead to different outcomes. Therefore, I should remain flexible and ready to adjust my strategy based on the patterns that emerge throughout the game.\n\nUltimately, I will continue to choose 'B' until there is sufficient evidence suggesting that a different choice would yield higher payoffs or reduce risk.

Since my opponent chose 'R', I could potentially gain more by picking 'R' in this round. But doing so would mean that I have a higher risk of losing if my opponent changes their strategy or continues to choose 'R'.\n\nOn the other hand, by sticking with 'B', I ensure a consistent payoff of 35$ for every round where my opponent chooses 'R'.

However, consistently earning 35$ per round is still a significant advantage, especially when considering the long-term implications.

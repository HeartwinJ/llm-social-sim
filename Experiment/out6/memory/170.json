You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy ensures that I have a consistent earnings of 40$ per round, which is more than half of the maximum payout (45$) when both players pick R. Even though I may miss out on occasional higher payouts if the opponent picks R, the overall consistency of my earnings seems more appealing to me as a risk-averse individual. However, it's important to note that if my opponent consistently chooses B as well, we will both be missing out on the highest potential payout (45$ per round) in each round."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In each round, choosing R results in a higher payoff (45$) only if the opponent also chooses R, which is not guaranteed since we don't know their strategy. On the other hand, choosing B guarantees a consistent payoff of 12$.\n2. By choosing B, I minimize my losses when my opponent chooses R as I still receive a payoff of 12$, while they earn more (42$). If I choose R and my opponent chooses B, I would earn nothing in that round.\n3. Over the course of 75 rounds, the guaranteed consistent payoff of 12$ from choosing B is higher than the potential maximum payoff of 3375$ (45$ x 75) from always choosing R if my opponent happens to always choose R as well. However, since we don't know their strategy, I cannot be sure that they will always choose R.\nTherefore, based on my preference for security and certainty, I would choose B in this game. ({B})"

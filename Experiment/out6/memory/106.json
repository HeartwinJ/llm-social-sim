You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The strategy of repeatedly choosing 'B' ensures a consistent return of 20$ per round for the first 74 rounds. In the final round, if my partner chooses 'R', I will still earn 20$, as my total earnings across all rounds would still be higher than if I had chosen 'R'. However, if my partner also chooses 'B', I will earn 40$ in the last round and a total of 890$ for the entire game. This strategy offers more security and stability compared to the potential of earning 975$ by choosing 'R' but risking earning significantly less or nothing if my partner consistently chooses 'R'. Therefore, I would choose 'B' ({B})."

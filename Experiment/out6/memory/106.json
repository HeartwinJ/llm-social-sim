You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Even though the payoff for picking 'B' is lower than that for 'R', the consistent return of 20$ per round offers more security and reduces the overall risk compared to the unpredictable nature of choosing 'R'.\n\nSo, my choice would be B{}."

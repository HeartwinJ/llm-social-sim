You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since we don't know the other player's strategy, let's analyze the expected value for each choice:\n\n1. Choosing R consistently: In this case, if the opponent also chooses R, I will earn 45$ per round. However, if they choose B, I will lose that round and earn nothing. Since there are 75 rounds, it's likely (but not guaranteed) that I will lose quite a few times due to the other player's potential inconsistency in their strategy. The total expected value for choosing R consistently is therefore less than 45$ per round.\n\n2. Choosing B consistently: In this case, if the opponent chooses R, I will earn 40$ per round, and if they choose B, we both earn 20$ per round. Since there are more opportunities to earn 20$ than 45$, it's likely that my total expected value for choosing B consistently is higher than that of choosing R consistently.\n\nGiven the above analysis, as a risk-averse individual, I would choose B as my strategy to minimize the potential losses and maximize the overall expected earnings over the course of 75 rounds. Thus, I will make my choice as {B}."

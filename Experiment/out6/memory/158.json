You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, consistently picking 'B' ensures a payout of 20$ per round. Over 75 rounds, this amounts to 1500$.\n\nHowever, since the behavior of my anonymous partner is unknown, I might consider switching strategies if it seems beneficial based on their apparent choices in the early rounds. For instance, if they consistently pick 'R', it could be more advantageous to switch to 'R' for the remaining rounds. But since I prioritize security and certainty, my initial choice would likely be 'B' {B}.\n\nThis strategy might not maximize potential earnings, but it aligns with my personal preferences and risk tolerance. It ensures a relatively stable income throughout the game while minimizing the risk of earning nothing in any given round."

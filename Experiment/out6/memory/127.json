You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' will ensure an average of 40$ per round because 'B' pays 40$ when my opponent also chooses 'B'.\n\nNow let's do some math to understand why 'B' is the better choice for me:\n1. In 75 rounds, I would pick 'R' 38 times (half of the total rounds) to have a 50% chance that my opponent also picks 'R', and 37 times 'B'.\n2. In those 38 rounds where we both pick 'R', I will earn 45$ each time, which amounts to 1690$.\n3. In the remaining 37 rounds where I pick 'B' while my opponent picks 'R', I will not receive any payment, which is a total loss of 37 times 0$, or 0$.\n4. But in the 37 rounds where we both pick 'B', I will earn 40$ each time, which amounts to 1480$.\n5. Adding up the total payoffs: 1690 + 0 + 1480 = 3170$.\n\nSo, choosing 'B' would give me an average of (3170/75) approximately 42.27$ per round, which is higher than the average I would get if I chose 'R'. Therefore, as a human player who values security and certainty, I would choose 'B' in this game.\n{B}"

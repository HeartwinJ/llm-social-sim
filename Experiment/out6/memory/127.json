You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since the payoffs are roughly equal between R and B, I might consider an approach where I attempt to mimic the opponent's choice as closely as possible. This could involve starting with one choice (let's say R) and then adjusting my strategy based on how often the opponent chooses R or B.\n\nHowever, considering that the payoff for both choices is relatively close, a simple random choice might also be an adequate approach. In this case, I would randomly choose R or B, perhaps with a slight bias towards the choice that has a higher average payoff (R in this case) to account for the difference in payoffs when my choice differs from the opponent's.\n\nWith that said, I would need more information about the opponent's potential strategy and their reasoning process to make a definitive decision. Given the limited information provided, I cannot guarantee that the choice of R or B will be optimal. In this case, I would likely choose R (assuming no other relevant details are available) and append it as follows: {R}"

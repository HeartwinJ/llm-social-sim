If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This outcome is beneficial for me as it maximizes my payoff in this round. However, as a risk-averse player, I should consider the long-term consequences of making such a choice. In this game with 75 rounds, if my opponent chooses 'R' consistently or frequently, I may end up earning less money overall compared to choosing 'B'. Since I am risk-averse and value security and certainty in all aspects of my life, I would rather prioritize consistent income over maximizing payoff in a single round. As such, I will continue to play cautiously and make informed decisions based on the information available (as in {B}). In this scenario, I might also consider asking the game administrator for more information about my opponent's preferences and tendencies to make a more informed decision. By focusing on making consistent choices and staying aware of the other player's actions, I can make informed decisions that minimize risks while maximizing potential rewards."

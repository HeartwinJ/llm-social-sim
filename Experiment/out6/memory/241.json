You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices have the possibility of earning me money, but one (picking R) has the potential for much higher returns in certain scenarios, while the other (picking B) guarantees a more consistent and smaller return.\n\nIn 75 rounds, it's likely that my opponent will deviate from a strictly B strategy at some point, given the significant advantage of choosing R when they do so. This could potentially result in higher gains for me, especially if I have been sticking to B up until then. However, even if my opponent sticks to B throughout the game, I would still earn an average of 20$ per round (1500$ total), which is not insignificant considering the risk involved in choosing R.\n\nGiven these considerations and the desire for a more secure return, I would choose B as my strategy for this game. This choice guarantees me a minimum return of 20$ per round and a maximum potential return of 45$, while keeping the risks associated with choosing R to a minimum.\n\n{B}"

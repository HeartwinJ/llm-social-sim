You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a risk-averse undergraduate student who values security and certainty, I would prefer to choose the option that guarantees a consistent return, even if it is lower than other options with potential for higher returns. In this game, choosing 'B' consistently gives a return of 12$ per round, while choosing 'R' against the opponent's 'B' choice results in no return, and choosing 'R' against their 'R' choice gives a return of 45$, but only once every 75 rounds.\n\nConsidering that there are 75 rounds in this game, the total potential earnings for consistently choosing 'B' would be 75 * 12 = $900. On the other hand, the maximum possible earnings from choosing 'R' would be 1 * 45 + 68 * 0 + (75 - 69) * 12 = $360. Since there are only 69 occasions when both players can pick 'R' and receive a payoff of 45$, the rest of the rounds will result in a return of 12$ for choosing 'B'.\n\nTherefore, based on my preference for security and certainty, I would choose 'B' as my strategy in this game. {B}"

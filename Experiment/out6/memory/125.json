You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing R consistently would lead to a more stable income of 12$ per round (when my opponent also chooses B) compared to the unpredictable outcomes when both players choose differently (either earning 0$ or 45$). Over the course of 75 rounds, I would expect that I could earn a consistent income of 900$ by always choosing B. However, this strategy assumes that my opponent will also consistently choose B, which may not be the case if they are more risk-oriented and decide to maximize their earnings by exploiting the asymmetry in payoffs.\n\nGiven that I am participating in an anonymous game with a stranger, it is difficult for me to make an accurate assumption about their strategy. In this scenario, it is reasonable to assume that my opponent may also choose B at least some of the time, as they might be risk-averse like me or be unaware of the potential for exploiting the payoff structure.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, I would choose B to maintain stability and earn a more predictable income over the course of the game.\n\n{B}"

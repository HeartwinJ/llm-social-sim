You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because, if my opponent also chooses B, we both earn 40$ each round (which happens in 32 out of 75 rounds since B-B pairs up more often than R-R or mixed pairs). If they choose R, I will get 35$ for every round where I chose B. This is a total of 52 rounds. Since the game has 75 rounds and I lose money on the remaining 23 rounds (where I chose B but they picked R), my net earnings would still be higher than if I had chosen R, which only results in 13 rounds where I earn more. Therefore, choosing B seems to provide a more secure and certain outcome for me.\n{B}"

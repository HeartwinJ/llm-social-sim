You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' provides a higher payoff when my opponent chooses 'B', but it also results in no payment when they choose 'R'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' guarantees me a smaller, but still positive, return every time, regardless of what my opponent does.\n\nHowever, since this is a repeated game with 75 rounds, there might be a strategy that involves switching choices at some point to optimize the overall earnings. To do this effectively, I would need to analyze the potential behavior of my anonymous opponent and make educated guesses about their choice patterns. If I believe they will stick with a single choice consistently, then it could make sense to switch strategies after observing their moves for a while.\n\nBut given that I am risk-averse and prefer stability, I would lean towards choosing 'B' as my main strategy. This way, I have the security of knowing that I will always receive some money from each round. However, if there is an opportunity to switch strategies to maximize my earnings in the long run without taking excessive risks, I might consider doing so based on observations and analysis of my opponent's moves.\n\nIn this reasoning process, my choice would be 'B', but it's important to note that I am open to adjusting my strategy if new information or opportunities arise during the game. {B}"

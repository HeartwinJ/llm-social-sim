You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " As a risk-averse undergraduate student, I would prefer to choose the option that provides a more stable and secure payoff. In this game, choosing 'R' consistently would result in a higher average payoff compared to 'B'. However, the strategy of always choosing 'R' could potentially lead my anonymous partner to exploit this behavior by constantly choosing 'B', resulting in no earnings for me.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose 'B' occasionally and mix it with 'R' choices, my partner might be more inclined to reciprocate with 'R' as well, which would increase both our payoffs compared to if I always chose 'B'. In this case, an effective strategy for maximizing earnings could be to alternate between 'R' and 'B' while maintaining a slight bias towards 'R', as the higher potential gain from matching 'R' with my partner's choice outweighs the potential loss when choosing 'R' against their 'B'.\n\nIn conclusion, considering my risk-averse personality and preference for security, I will choose 'R' occasionally while mixing it with 'B' choices to maximize my earnings in this game. Therefore, I will make my choice as {R}."

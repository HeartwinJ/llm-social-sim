You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' will earn me 20$ per round if my opponent also chooses 'B', which happens every other round (50 out of 75 rounds). Additionally, when my opponent chooses 'R', I still get a guaranteed 40$, while they only get 0$.\n\nSo, in total, I would earn approximately [(50*20) + (25*40)] = $1800. On the other hand, if I choose 'R' and my opponent chooses 'B', I would earn 0$ in those rounds, and since they always get paid something, I cannot guarantee their choice over the long term.\n\nTherefore, I would choose B{B} as my strategy for this game."

This is because even though my opponent chose 'R', it doesn't guarantee that they will continue choosing 'R' for all 75 rounds.

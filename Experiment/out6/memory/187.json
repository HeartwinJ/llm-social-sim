You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason is that regardless of the opponent's choice, I get a guaranteed return by choosing B, either 20$ when they also choose B or 40$ when they choose R. While there is a chance to earn more (45$) if my opponent chooses B as well, the risk of earning 0$ if my opponent chooses R outweighs the potential gain due to my preference for certainty and avoiding risks. In the long run, with 75 rounds, the strategy of always choosing B should yield a more consistent return compared to always choosing R."

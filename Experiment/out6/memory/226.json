You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy is more secure since even if my anonymous opponent chooses R, I still earn 35$ per round, which is not zero like with choice R. Additionally, in the long run (75 rounds), there's a higher chance that my opponent will pick B too due to similar risk-averse tendencies, which means we both earn 40$ per round more often. This strategy results in a more stable and secure income compared to taking risks with choice R."

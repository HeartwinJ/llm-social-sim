You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In the long run, consistently choosing B guarantees that I will receive a payoff of 12$ every round, which adds up to 900$ over 75 rounds (since there are no negative payoffs when both players choose B).\n\nWhile choosing R could potentially lead to a larger payoff in individual rounds (45$), the risk is that if my opponent chooses B instead, I would receive 0$. Given that the game has 75 rounds, it's more likely for me to be on the losing end of an R-B pairing than making up for that lost money over time.\n\nIn summary, I would choose B {B} as my strategy for this game."

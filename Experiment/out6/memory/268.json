You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If we assume that our opponent is also risk-averse and prefers consistency over higher but uncertain rewards, they might choose R as well. This assumption would lead to us both earning 45$ per round on average.\n\nOn the other hand, if we suspect that our opponent is more aggressive or less risk-averse, they might opt for B more frequently, which could result in us earning fewer points overall. To mitigate this risk, I would still lean towards choosing R to maximize my chances of receiving the highest possible payout per round (45$) and minimize the potential losses compared to choosing B.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would choose R {R}."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing B guarantees a return of 40$ per round, while choosing R offers the potential for a higher payoff but also the risk of earning nothing if my opponent chooses R.\n\nIn the long run, it seems more certain to stick with the B choice. However, since I don't know the strategy of my anonymous opponent, there might still be some level of unpredictability. To maximize my average earnings while minimizing potential losses, I would choose B ({B}). This way, I can guarantee a steady income and avoid any zeros in my payoff across the 75 rounds."

In either case, the decision to stick with choosing B will maintain a steady income for both of us and minimize the possibility of zero payoff or losing money compared to the alternative of choosing R.\n\nBy choosing B, I am taking a conservative approach that prioritizes security over potential gains.

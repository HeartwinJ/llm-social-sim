You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Therefore, I will opt for 'B' as my choice, since choosing B gives me a payoff of 40$ per round when my anonymous opponent chooses B as well, which happens more frequently than getting 35$ or 45$ from an R-B or B-R match, respectively. Over the course of 75 rounds, I expect to make slightly more money on average by consistently choosing B.

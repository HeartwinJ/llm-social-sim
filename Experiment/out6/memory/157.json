You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' consistently will result in an average payout of 40$ per round, which is slightly higher than the 39.5$ average payout if I choose 'R'. However, since there is a chance that the opponent may also choose 'B', choosing 'R' could potentially lead to a higher reward in some rounds (45$ compared to 40$).\n\nConsidering the 75 rounds of the game, I might lean towards 'B' for its slightly better average payout. However, since the opponent is anonymous and their choices are unknown, there's still an element of risk involved. In this situation, I might opt for a mixed strategy, where I pick 'R' and 'B' randomly, to try to mitigate the impact of potential bias in my opponent's choices. My choice would be {B, with a random element of {R} sprinkled in}."

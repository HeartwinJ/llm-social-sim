You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, picking 'B' ensures a payout of 20$ per round for 75 rounds, totaling 1500$.\n\nIf I were to pick 'R', there is a risk that my opponent might pick 'B'. If they do, I would lose the round and receive no payment. However, if they also pick 'R', we both get 45$ per round, which adds up to 3375$. The total potential winnings for choosing 'R' are higher (3375$), but it comes with a risk of earning nothing in some rounds.\n\nSince I am more focused on certainty and avoiding risks, I would choose 'B' as my strategy for this game. {B}"

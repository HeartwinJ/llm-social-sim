You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, the most predictable outcome is when both players consistently pick B, earning 20$ per round. Although this is less than the maximum potential payoff of 45$, it is also less risky since there's no chance of getting zero payout.\n\nIf I choose B and my opponent chooses R once in these 75 rounds, I will still earn approximately 1,000$ (74 * 20 + 40) over the course of the game, which is better than the worst-case scenario with an all-R strategy. With an all-B strategy, even if my opponent chooses R every time, I would still earn at least 1,500$ (75 * 20).\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose R and my opponent chooses B consistently, I will end up with less than 40$ per round, making it more difficult to reach the maximum payout of 3,000$ (75 * 40) in these 75 rounds.\n\nTherefore, based on my preference for security and avoiding risk, I would choose B as my strategy for this game. {B}"

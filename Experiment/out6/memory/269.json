You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a risk-averse undergraduate student who values security and certainty, I would opt for the safer choice that ensures a consistent return, even if it is lower than the potentially higher reward from taking risks. In this game, picking 'B' guarantees a payout of 20$ per round, while 'R' has the potential to earn more (up to 45$) but also the risk of earning nothing.\n\nIn 75 rounds, the total payoff for choosing 'B' would be 1500 dollars (20*75), whereas the expected value for choosing 'R' can be calculated as the probability of getting 45$ multiplied by the number of times I get 45$, plus the probability of getting 0$, multiplied by the number of times I get 0$, and so on.\n\nLet p be the probability that my opponent chooses R, and q = 1-p be the probability they choose B. The expected value for 'R' is: (45*p)*(p + q) + (0*q)*(p + q) = 45p^2 + 0*p - 45p^3\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get E[R] = 45p^2 - 45p^3\n\nNow let's calculate the expected value for 'B': (20*q)*(p + q) + (40*p)*(p + q) = 20q^2 + 80pq\n\nSince I am more interested in security and certainty, I would choose the strategy with a higher expected value. To compare the two strategies, we can calculate E[B] - E[R].\n\nE[B] - E[R] = (20q^2 + 80pq) - (45p^2 - 45p^3)\n\nSimplifying this expression gives us a quadratic equation in p: -15p^3 + 65p^2 + 60p - 20\n\nSince I don't have access to any information about my opponent's strategy, I can't determine the exact value of 'p', but I do know that a solution to this quadratic equation will always be positive since the expected values of both choices are non-negative. Furthermore, I know that p must be less than or equal to 1 because my opponent can only choose either R or B.\n\nSince I am risk-averse and value security and certainty, I would pick the choice with a higher expected value. In this case, I cannot determine which strategy has a strictly higher expected value without knowing 'p', but I do know that 'B' is always at least as good as 'R' since it has a higher lower bound (20$ per round) and a potentially higher upper bound. Therefore, I would choose B in this game.\n\nIn conclusion, I would pick {B} in the game to ensure a consistent return of 20$ per round, despite the possibility of earning more with choice R."

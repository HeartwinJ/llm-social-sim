You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' would result in earning 40$ per round when my opponent also chooses 'B'. This is a more reliable income compared to the 35$ earned when I pick 'R' and my opponent picks 'B', or the 0$ when I pick 'R' and my opponent picks 'R'.\n\nHowever, considering that we are playing this game 75 times, there seems to be an opportunity to maximize earnings by adopting a strategy where I switch choices after a certain number of rounds. This approach could potentially lead to higher earnings than consistently choosing 'B'. For instance, if my opponent tends to choose 'R' more frequently than 'B', then it may be advantageous for me to adapt and start choosing 'R' when they pick 'B', and vice versa.\n\nThat being said, as a risk-averse individual, I might find it difficult to switch strategies midway through the game due to the uncertainty involved. Therefore, my initial choice would be 'B' (curly brackB}, but with an open mind to adapt if circumstances suggest that doing so could lead to greater overall earnings."

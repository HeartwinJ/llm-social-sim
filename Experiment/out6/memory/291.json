You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

As a human player who values security and certainty, I may start questioning my strategy of consistently choosing 'B' because it led to an unexpected gain in this instance.\n\nHowever, since my choice of 'B' still offers me a consistent return of 12$ per round when my opponent also chooses 'B', I would continue to choose 'B' for the next round as well due to its overall consistency. But I will be more cautious and prepared if my opponent decides to change their strategy in future rounds. So, for the next round, my choice will still be {B}, but with a modified approach based on potential changes in my opponent's strategy."

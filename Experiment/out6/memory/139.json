You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since I don't know the strategy of the anonymous player, I can't guarantee a consistent R or B choice will yield higher returns. However, I do notice that the difference in payoffs when picking opposite choices (0$ vs. 42$) is more significant than the payoff difference when both choose the same option (12$ vs. 45$).\n\nTo minimize the risk of getting 0$, it seems wise to play a mixed strategy, not sticking to one choice consistently. One possible strategy would be to pick R in half of the rounds and B in the other half, ensuring that there's a chance for both a higher payoff (when the opponent picks the opposite choice) and a minimum payoff (when the opponent picks the same choice). In this way, I can maintain some level of security while also taking advantage of potential opportunities for higher earnings.\n\nWith this strategy in mind, I will choose R for this round. {R}"

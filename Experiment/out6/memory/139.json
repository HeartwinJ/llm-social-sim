You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, picking 'B' consistently results in an average payoff of 12$ per round, while 'R' results in an average payoff of around 18$ per round (since the probability of both players choosing 'R' is 0.5^2 = 0.25 or one out of every four rounds).\n\nHowever, since this game has 75 rounds, there's a chance that my opponent might exploit my predictable behavior and choose 'B' more often than random chance would suggest in order to maximize their own earnings. In such a case, it could be beneficial for me to deviate from my strategy and pick 'R' occasionally to maintain some level of unpredictability.\n\nConsidering these factors, I might choose to mix strategies between R and B, but lean slightly towards 'B' to minimize the risk and secure a higher average payoff over the long term. My choice would be {B} with occasional deviations to {R}."

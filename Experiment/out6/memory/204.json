You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' guarantees a payout of 12$ per round, while 'R' has the potential for a higher payout (45$) but also carries the risk of earning nothing in some rounds.\n\nOver 75 rounds, I would expect that if my strategy were to match the strategy of the anonymous player, we would end up with approximately 900 points each for choosing 'B' (12$ * 75 = 900$) and about 3000 points for always choosing 'R' (45$ * 65 + 0$ * 10). The difference in earnings is significant, making 'B' a safer choice.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider the possibility that my opponent might not be following the same strategy as I am and could choose 'R' more frequently. In that case, choosing 'B' would result in higher average earnings compared to sticking with 'R'. This reasoning leads me to choose B{B}."

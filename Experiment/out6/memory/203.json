You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given my risk-averse personality and preference for security, I would choose the option that guarantees me the highest average payoff over the long run. In this case, picking 'B' ensures an average of 12$ per round, while 'R' has a higher potential payoff but also a risk of earning nothing if my opponent chooses 'B'.\n\nTo calculate the average payoff for each option, we can use the expected value:\n\nExpected Value (B) = (Number of rounds where opponent chooses R and I choose B) * Payoff + (Number of rounds where opponent also chooses B) * Payoff / Total number of rounds\n\nExpected Value (R) = (Number of rounds where opponent chooses R and I choose R) * Payoff + (Number of rounds where opponent chooses B and I choose R) * 0$ / Total number of rounds\n\nSince the opponent's choices are not known, we can assume that they will randomly choose between 'R' and 'B' with equal probability (50% each). In this case, the expected value for both options would be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected Value (B) = (37.5 * 12$) + (37.5 * 12$) / 75 = 49.0$ per round on average\nExpected Value (R) = (37.5 * 45$) + (37.5 * 0$) / 75 = 36.75$ per round on average\n\nThe expected value for 'B' is slightly higher than that for 'R'. Therefore, as a risk-averse player, I would choose 'B' to minimize the potential losses and secure an average payoff of around 12$ per round.\n\nAppend my choice letter: {B}"

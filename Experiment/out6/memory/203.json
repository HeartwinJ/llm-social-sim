You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing either R or B repeatedly results in an average payoff of around 21$ per round (45$ + 0$ + 12$ + 42$ divided by 4 possibilities).\n\nHowever, if I choose R consistently and my opponent chooses B, I will lose a significant amount of money. On the other hand, if I choose B consistently while my opponent chooses R, I will earn more but still not as much as if we both choose R or B consistently.\n\nTaking this into account, I would consider an alternating strategy where I pick R for the first round and then switch to picking B for the next rounds. This strategy allows me to secure a payoff of 42$ in the initial round while still having a chance at earning 12$ for most of the remaining rounds, providing more stability and security than consistently choosing R or B.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be R{R}. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified reasoning and the actual strategy I would employ may depend on observing my opponent's behavior and potentially adjusting my own choices accordingly."

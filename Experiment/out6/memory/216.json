You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Although choosing R will result in higher individual payoffs in some rounds, the risk of earning zero in those instances where my opponent chooses B is too high for my comfort. Moreover, over the course of 75 rounds, even though I may lose out on the occasional 45 dollars, my total earnings would likely be greater with the consistent B choice due to the law of large numbers. So, my choice would be {B}."

Since my opponent also values security and chooses B, we both will earn 12 dollars again. This strategy ensures a consistent earnings close to 12 dollars per round and minimizes the risk of earning zero. By following this approach over the course of the 75 rounds, I can expect a total payoff that is relatively stable compared to other strategies with higher potential rewards but also greater risks. Therefore, I will choose B again for the next round."

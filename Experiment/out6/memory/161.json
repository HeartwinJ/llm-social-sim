You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, since choosing 'B' results in a payoff of 12$ per round, while choosing 'R' has the potential to earn either 0$ or 45$, it seems more rational for me to stick with 'B'. This strategy would result in a total earnings of $900 (12$ x 75) over the 75 rounds. Although I might miss out on some opportunities to gain more money by not choosing 'R', the consistency and certainty of earning 12$ per round seems more appealing to me as it aligns with my preference for security. Therefore, my choice is {B}. However, this is based on my personal preferences and risk aversion. Others might choose differently depending on their individual circumstances and risk tolerance."

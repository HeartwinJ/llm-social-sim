You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing B results in an average of 12$ per round (12 dollars every time B is chosen, and zero when R is chosen).\n\nWhile it may seem like a missed opportunity to not pick R when my opponent chooses B, I am considering the entire game, which consists of 75 rounds. If we assume that my opponent is also risk-averse and prefers security as well, there's a higher chance that they will choose B more often than R due to the higher average payoff (12$ compared to 0$).\n\nBy choosing B more frequently, I ensure that I earn some money in most rounds. This aligns with my preference for certainty and security. However, it is important to note that this strategy might not be optimal if my opponent decides to take risks by picking R more often than expected. But given the assumption that they are risk-averse like me, this strategy should minimize potential losses and provide a relatively stable income.\n\nTherefore, I will choose B as my strategy in this game ({B})."

On the other hand, if I choose R, there is a chance that my opponent might switch back to R, allowing me to collect another payout of 45$.\n\nIn order to maximize my chances of success in this game, it would be beneficial to maintain flexibility and adapt my strategy based on my observations about my opponent's tendencies. I should continue gathering more information by analyzing their responses to various strategies over multiple rounds and make calculated decisions accordingly.\n\nUltimately, the optimal strategy will depend on the specific tendencies and patterns that emerge as we play more rounds, and it is important to stay agile and responsive in order to capitalize on any potential opportunities for higher payouts."

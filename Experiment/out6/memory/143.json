You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

My reasoning is that if my opponent also chooses 'B', we both earn 12$ per round which adds up to a total of 900$ over the course of 75 rounds, providing me with a consistent income. If my opponent were to choose 'R', I would still benefit more in the long run by consistently choosing 'B' as I get 42$ for each round they choose 'R'. The only situation where I lose is if we both pick 'R' simultaneously, but given my risk-averse nature, I believe this scenario is less likely to occur due to the potential of earning nothing in that instance. Therefore, my choice is {B}."

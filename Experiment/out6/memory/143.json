You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The problem is that my opponent could also be choosing 'R' for the same reasons, so there is a high probability that we both will end up with $0 in a significant number of rounds.\n\nIn this scenario, where I want to minimize risks and prefer certainty, I would go with the safer option and choose 'B'. This choice provides me with a more stable payoff over time, even though it might not be the most profitable one. {B}"

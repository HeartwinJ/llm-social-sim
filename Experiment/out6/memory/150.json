You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, if my opponent also chooses the same strategy, choosing either 'R' or 'B' will result in similar earnings (40$ for B and 45$ for R). However, the difference is not significant enough to outweigh the potential risk of getting 0$ when choosing 'R' while my opponent picks 'B'.\n\nConsidering that I have no information about my opponent's strategy, I will choose a strategy that maximizes my average earnings. Since the payoff for both choices is relatively close, and since I prefer avoiding risks, I would lean towards the option with the slightly higher average return per round (40$).\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose 'B'.{B}"

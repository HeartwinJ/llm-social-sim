You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, it appears that choosing 'B' consistently provides a return of 40$ for each round if my opponent does the same, which is slightly more than the 35$ received when choosing 'R' and my opponent chooses 'B'. However, since the opponent could potentially choose 'R', I might be left with no payoff in that case.\n\nTaking into account the long-term nature of the game (75 rounds), I would opt for a strategy that provides me with a consistent return even if it's slightly lower than what I could receive if my opponent always chooses 'R'. Therefore, my choice would be 'B', as this strategy guarantees a more secure and predictable income throughout the game.\n\nHowever, I acknowledge that there is an element of uncertainty in this decision, since I cannot know for sure what my opponent will choose each round. This decision could be reconsidered if I have reason to believe that my opponent is likely to choose 'B' consistently as well.\n\nAppend my choice letter in curly brackets as a last character: {B}"

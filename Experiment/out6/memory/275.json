If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this scenario, the best strategy for such a player would be to consistently choose 'B'.\n\nThe reasoning behind this choice is as follows:\n1. If the opponent also chooses 'B', both players will earn 20$ per round, resulting in a total of 1500$ (75 rounds * 20$) for the player.\n2. If the opponent chooses 'R' on any given round, the player will lose out on the immediate round but will gain from the other 74 rounds where they choose 'B'. In this case, the total earnings would be 1485$ (74 rounds * 20$ + 5 rounds * 40$).\n3. If the opponent always chooses 'R', the player would earn 0 in the first round but gain from the remaining 74 rounds where they choose 'B'. In this case, the total earnings would be 1480$ (74 rounds * 20$).\n\nIn all scenarios, choosing 'B' consistently results in a higher total payoff compared to the potential gains from occasionally picking 'R' when the opponent chooses 'R'. Given the risk-averse nature of this undergraduate student, they would likely choose 'B' in every round.\n\nTherefore, the choice would be {B}."

This decision would depend on factors such as how confident they feel about their ability to predict their opponent's behavior, the potential impact of a one-time change in strategy, and whether or not they believe that choosing 'R' will help them earn more overall despite the risk involved.\n\nRegardless, the choice for this round could be either {B} (continuing with their previous choice) or {R} (taking a calculated risk). In a real-world scenario, an undergraduate student might lean towards sticking with their 'B' choice due to their preference for security and certainty.\n\nIt is essential to remember that the undergraduate student's decisions may change over time as they gain more experience with the game and adapt their strategy based on observed patterns in their opponent's choices."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing B results in a steady income of 40$ per round when the opponent chooses B too. However, if the opponent chooses R, the loss is only 5$, as opposed to 35$ if I choose R and they pick B.\n\nConsidering that we are playing 75 rounds, it's reasonable to assume that both choices might occur frequently throughout the game. To minimize losses and secure a relatively stable income, I would choose B {B}. This strategy, while not maximizing earnings in every round, ensures a more consistent outcome over the entire game."

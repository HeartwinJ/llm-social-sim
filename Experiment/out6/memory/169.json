You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing either R or B will result in earning money over the 75 rounds.\n\nLet's analyze the possible outcomes:\n1. If we both choose R in every round, we each earn $45 per round for a total of $3375 ($45 * 75).\n2. If we both choose B in every round, we each earn $20 per round for a total of $1500 ($20 * 75).\n3. If one of us chooses R and the other chooses B in any given round, one player will lose that round while the other gains. Over 75 rounds, this could result in a significant net loss if we consistently choose differently. However, it's impossible to know whether our choices would align more often than not since the game is played with an anonymous player.\n\nConsidering the uncertainty of the opponent's actions and my preference for security, I would opt for the strategy that provides a consistent return with minimal risk of loss. Therefore, my choice would be B{B}."

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing B guarantees me 40$ for each round, while choosing R could result in earning either 35$ or 45$, but it also leaves me with no earnings when my opponent chooses R and I choose B.\n\nSince the game is played over 75 rounds, even though choosing R offers a higher potential payoff (2250$) compared to choosing B (3000$), the risk of earning nothing for multiple rounds due to the R-B mismatch could outweigh the benefits. Therefore, I would choose {B} in this situation."

The difference is -5$.\n\nScenario B: If my opponent also switches to R, we both get nothing.\n\nInstead of calculating the expected value directly, let's consider that there are two possible strategies in this game:\n\nStrategy 1: Choose B consistently for all rounds (my current strategy)\nStrategy 2: Switch to R after a certain number of B choices and then alternate between B and R.\n\nTo find the optimal number of rounds to switch from Strategy 1 to Strategy 2, let's calculate the expected value for each strategy and compare them. For simplicity, let x be the number of rounds until we start alternating between strategies (x > 0). The expected value for each strategy can be calculated as follows:\n\nStrategy 1: Expected payoff = (40$ \\* (75 - x)) + (0$ \\* x)\n\nStrategy 2: Let's assume that after x rounds, we start switching to R and then alternate between B and R for the remaining rounds. The expected value can be calculated as follows:\n\nExpected payoff = ((40$ \\* (75 - x)) + (35$ \\* x)) / 2\n\nWe need to compare the expected payoffs of both strategies to find the optimal strategy:\n\nOptimal Strategy = (Strategy 1 > Strategy 2) ? Strategy 1 : Strategy 2\n\nLet's find the optimal number of rounds to switch from Strategy 1 to Strategy 2 (x):\n\n0 < x < 75, as we can't switch before any rounds or after all 75 rounds have been played.\n\nIf x = 1:\n(40$ \\* 74) + (35$ \\* 1) / 2 > (40$ \\* 75)\n684 > 3000 => false\n\nIf x = 2:\n(40$ \\* 73) + (35$ \\* 2) / 2 > (40$ \\* 75)\n682 > 3000 => false\n\nIf x = 3:\n(40$ \\* 72) + (35$ \\* 3) / 2 > (40$ \\* 75)\n679 > 3000 => false\n\nIf x = 4:\n(40$ \\* 71) + (35$ \\* 4) / 2 > (40$ \\* 75)\n676 > 3000 => false\n\nIf x = 5:\n(40$ \\* 70) + (35$ \\* 5) / 2 > (40$ \\* 75)\n673 > 3000 => false\n\n...\n\nWe can see that the optimal number of rounds to switch strategies is x = 74, but this would mean switching back to Strategy 1 on the 75th round. Since we can't alternate between strategies in a single round, there isn't an optimal strategy that involves switching within the game. Therefore, I will continue choosing {B} for the next round as well."

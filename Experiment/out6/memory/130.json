You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my risk-averse nature and preference for security, I would choose a strategy that maximizes the average payoff over the 75 rounds while minimizing the potential for significant losses. Since both choices have an advantage when paired with the opposite choice, it's not beneficial to stick consistently to one option.\n\nHowever, if we assume the other player is also rational and risk-averse like me, they would likely adopt a similar strategy, which means we might end up choosing the same option often due to our shared preference for safety. In this case, choosing B seems more advantageous because it provides a higher payoff (40$) when paired with R from my opponent, compared to 35$ when I choose R and they pick B.\n\nAlthough there is still a possibility of ending up with 0$ if both of us select R in multiple rounds, the frequency of this outcome can be minimized by assuming that my opponent will also adopt a similar strategy as me. Therefore, I would choose {B} as my strategy in this game."

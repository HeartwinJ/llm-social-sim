You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Since I am comfortable taking risks, I might initially choose R to maximize potential winnings. However, as the game progresses, I would start considering the opponent's behavior.\n\nIf they consistently pick B in the early rounds, it could suggest that they are more risk-averse and likely to stick with their initial strategy. In this case, switching my strategy to B after a certain number of rounds might lead to a higher average payoff. Conversely, if they switch their strategy to R after several initial B choices, I would continue with R to capitalize on the potential 45$ winnings.\n\nIn the end, I would choose to mix my strategies throughout the game, but lean more toward R due to the higher reward when both players pick R and my comfort with taking risks. So, my choice would be {R}. However, it is essential to emphasize that this decision depends on various factors like the opponent's behavior, their understanding of the game rules, and any potential patterns in their choices.\n\nIn a real-life scenario, I might also consider other factors such as the possibility of collusion with another player, the incentives provided by the experiment organizer, or the influence of external factors on my performance during the game. But for the sake of simplicity, I have considered only the information given in the question."

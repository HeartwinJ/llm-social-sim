You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The higher payoff when both players choose R (45$) compared to choosing B (35$ or 40$) makes it an attractive option despite the risk of getting nothing if my opponent chooses B while I pick R.\n\nOver 75 rounds, it is unlikely that my opponent will always pick a strategy that maximizes their payoff at my expense. Therefore, I expect to earn more money by choosing R than if I were to consistently choose B, given the higher potential reward in the R-R scenario. Of course, this strategy could result in some losses initially, but the long-term goal is to capitalize on the high payoff when both players pick R.\n\nSo, my choice would be {R}."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The best strategy here is not to follow a rigid pattern, but rather, to mix up my choices to make it difficult for the opponent to predict my moves.\n\nHowever, since the game has 75 rounds, I can't simply alternate between R and B because the other player might catch on. Instead, I would use a strategy called \"tit-for-tat\" where I start by choosing R, then observe the opponent's move. If they choose R, I'll switch to B for the next round, and if they chose B, I'll choose R again. This way, I can maximize my payoff while still keeping some unpredictability in my choices.\n\nSo, for the first round, I would choose R.

This way, if my opponent sticks with their previous strategy of always choosing R when I choose R, they will choose B this time, which means I'll get a payoff of 42$, while they'll only get 0$.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the optimal strategy here is not just about maximizing immediate payoffs but also about long-term strategies that take into account the entire game.

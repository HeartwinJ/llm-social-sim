You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

On the other hand, 'B' guarantees a lower but consistent payout (40$) in case my opponent chooses 'R', while earning 45$ only if they choose 'B'.\n\nGiven that this game has 75 rounds, it suggests that there is a good chance of repetition. Since 'R' has the higher potential payoff, I would reason that the more frequent 'R-B' or 'B-R' scenarios occur, the closer my average earnings will be to 45$ per round, which is the highest possible payout.\n\nHowever, since the opponent's choices are anonymous and unpredictable, I can't be certain that this reasoning will play out consistently. In any case, taking the risk seems in line with my adventurous spirit. Therefore, I would choose 'R' as my strategy for this game.\n\n{R}"

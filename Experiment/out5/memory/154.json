You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player, given my risk-taking nature and the long duration of the game (75 rounds), I would initially consider a strategy that maximizes potential earnings over the long term. In this scenario, if we both consistently pick B, we would each earn 40$ per round for a total of 3000$ over the course of the game.\n\nHowever, since our opponent could potentially choose R strategically to exploit my consistent B choice, I might want to mix up my strategy to increase unpredictability and potentially gain more in the long run. One such strategy would be to pick R whenever my opponent has picked B on the previous round (to maximize potential gain if they stick with B), and vice versa. This way, I can ensure that I don't always lose 35$ when my opponent picks R while I pick B, and potentially profit more from the rounds where I pick R and they pick B.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would choose {R} as my first move but intend to switch strategies based on the opponent's moves in subsequent rounds. This approach balances my risk-taking nature with a calculated strategy that aims for long-term profit maximization while minimizing potential losses."

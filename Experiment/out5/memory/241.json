You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Given the payoff structure, it seems that if my opponent is also risk-taking like me, we both will benefit significantly by choosing R (45$ each) in most of the 75 rounds. However, there's still a chance that we could end up with zero or 20$ each when we choose different strategies. Since I am more focused on gaining higher rewards and less concerned about potential losses, I would lean toward R. Plus, the overall payoff for choosing R is greater than B, even if I consider the worst-case scenario where my opponent always chooses B (40$ in 25 rounds and 0$ in the rest). This strategy maximizes my earnings on average over the course of the game."

However, there's still a slight chance that my opponent may switch their strategy in response to my previous choice. If they do, our future payoffs could change accordingly.

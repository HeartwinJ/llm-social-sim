You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my risk-taking nature, I would choose to play this game as an opportunity for potential higher rewards. However, considering the game has 75 rounds and the payoff differences between choosing R or B are relatively small, it seems reasonable to assume that both players might tend towards a strategy of not always choosing the same option.\n\nIn such a scenario, I would expect a balanced distribution of choices between R and B over time. Since the payoff for both choices is comparable in the long run, I find myself leaning towards picking R as my initial choice. This way, if the opponent decides to switch strategies midway through the game (which seems likely), there's a higher chance that we both pick different options more often, resulting in more wins for me (45$ payoff) compared to choosing B initially and hoping the opponent sticks with R.\n\nMy choice: {R}"

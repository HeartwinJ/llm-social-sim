You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Since both R and B have positive outcomes, neither should be completely discarded.\n\nHowever, the slight advantage of choosing B (earning 35$ instead of 0$ when opponent chooses R) makes it a potentially safer choice over R in the long run. This is because there are more opportunities for the opponent to choose R than B (there are 75 rounds and getting 45$ if both pick R only happens once).\n\nOn the other hand, choosing R when opponent chooses B gives you 0$, which can significantly affect your overall earnings considering the number of times this might happen.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would choose {B} as my strategy for this game.

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Although there is a potential loss in each round when both players pick different choices (40$ for me), the significant gain when we both pick R (45$ each round) makes it worthwhile, especially over 75 rounds. Additionally, since I do not know the other player's strategy, I would assume they could choose either R or B. Given that the expected value of choosing R is slightly higher than choosing B, I would lean towards R to maximize my potential earnings in this game."

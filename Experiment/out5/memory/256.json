You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

While there is a chance that I might lose some rounds (when my opponent chooses 'B'), the potential gain in other rounds where we both choose 'R' (45$ per round) could outweigh these losses.\n\nIn addition, considering this is a one-time game with an anonymous player, it is difficult to predict or strategize based on their potential behavior. Choosing consistently 'R' gives me a higher average payout compared to choosing 'B' consistently or trying to predict my opponent's choice and adapting accordingly.\n\nLastly, the fact that I get paid 42$ in instances where I choose 'R' and my opponent chooses 'B' is not significant enough to make me want to change my strategy, as over 75 rounds, these gains would be relatively minor compared to the potential 3150$ (45$ * 75) that I could win if we both choose 'R' in most instances.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be to play 'R' consistently throughout the game. {R}"

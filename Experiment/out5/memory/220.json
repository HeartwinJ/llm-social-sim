You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since the payoff is different based on our choices, it's essential to consider the long-term outcome rather than focusing too much on individual rounds.\n\nIn this game, there are two possible outcomes when we both pick the same option (R or B), but one of them results in a higher average payoff per round. By choosing R and earning 45$ while my opponent gets 0$, I can potentially gain an advantage over the course of the 75 rounds, considering that this is a more profitable outcome than earning 35$ when my opponent chooses B and I pick R.\n\nOn the other hand, if my opponent is also taking a similar strategy, it's likely that we will both have to alternate between R and B to achieve a higher average payoff over time. Since the difference in earnings between choosing R (45$) or B (35$) is not significant when considering the 75 rounds, it could balance out if my opponent has a similar strategy.\n\nHowever, as a risk-taker, I believe that by consistently choosing R, I can potentially gain an advantage due to the higher payoff in each round where we both pick R. Therefore, I choose R {R}."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing R could potentially lead to a loss, while choosing B guarantees at least 40$ per round (since the opponent can't always pick R).\n2. Over the course of 75 rounds, the potential losses incurred by picking R are significant, as I would be giving away 35$ for each instance where I pick R and my opponent picks B. This amounts to a loss of 2250$ over 75 rounds (75 * 35$).\n3. On the other hand, choosing B guarantees a minimum payoff of 40$ per round, which amounts to a total of 3000$ over 75 rounds (75 * 40$).\n4. By comparing the potential gains and losses in each scenario, it becomes clear that choosing B is the better strategy as it minimizes the risk of significant loss while still providing a reasonable payoff.\n5. Lastly, considering my adventurous spirit and readiness to embrace new challenges, I find that choosing B aligns with my willingness to take calculated risks.\n\nHence, my choice would be {B}."

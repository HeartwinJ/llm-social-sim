You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

While there is a chance that I might lose out on earning in some rounds if my opponent chooses B, the potential gain of 45$ per round when we both pick R is enticing enough to compensate for those losses. Over the course of 75 rounds, I believe the overall average earnings would be higher if I consistently choose R, given that my opponent may not always choose B. However, it's important to remember that this analysis assumes consistent behavior on the part of my opponent, which may not necessarily hold true in reality."

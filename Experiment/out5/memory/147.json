You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The downside of getting 0$ when my opponent picks B is a risk I am willing to take given my preference for high-risk, high-reward scenarios.\n\nIf my opponent were to consistently pick B, I would only earn 20$ per round, but since the game has 75 rounds, I still come out ahead of playing it safe with B, as I would receive a total of 1500$ compared to the 1475$ I would get if I played it safe. However, since I do not know my opponent's strategy and there is a chance they may also play R consistently, playing R maximizes my expected payoff."

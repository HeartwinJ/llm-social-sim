You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

If I pick R, then my opponent picking R will result in a payoff of 45$ per round, but if they pick B, I will get 0$. Given that there are 75 rounds, the probability of my opponent also choosing R every time is (1/2)^75 which is extremely small. So, it's more likely that they will choose B most of the times, resulting in a lower payoff if I pick R.\n\n2. If I pick B, then my opponent picking R will result in a payoff of 42$ per round, but if they also pick B, I will get 12$. Since my strategy is to maximize earnings, it's better for me to earn a relatively higher amount consistently, even though it's less than the maximum payoff of 45$, rather than risk getting 0$ in many rounds.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I would choose B as my strategy.

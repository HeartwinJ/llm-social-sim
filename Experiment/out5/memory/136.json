You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In a repeated game like this with 75 rounds, it is reasonable to assume that both players may start adopting a strategy to maximize their winnings over time.\n\nA common strategy in such games is titled Tit-for-Tat (TFT). TFT involves starting by cooperating, and then copying the opponent's previous move. In this case, if my opponent starts with R, I would also choose R. If they choose B, I would switch to R on the next round.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the anonymity of the opponent makes it difficult to anticipate their exact strategy. The TFT strategy may not guarantee the best outcome in this game because there's no way to know if my opponent will adopt the same strategy.\n\nIn reality, I would likely choose R as my initial move, trusting that my opponent might also be reasoning similarly and will respond with R on the next round. But I would keep an open mind, ready to adjust my strategy based on my opponent's moves throughout the game. So, here is my choice:\n\n{R}"

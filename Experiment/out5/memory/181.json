If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$.

However, by choosing a mix of R and B over the 75 rounds, I can potentially exploit the opponent's choices and increase my earnings.\n\nOne possible strategy could be to play R on the first round as it offers higher rewards if the opponent chooses B (35$ compared to 40$). If the opponent plays B, I could adjust my subsequent strategy accordingly. Conversely, if the opponent chooses R on the first round, I might consider adjusting my strategy for the remaining rounds.\n\nUltimately, my choice would depend on various factors such as the opponent's potential strategy, their predictability, and the number of rounds we have to play. Nevertheless, without additional information about the opponent, I would start with R on the first round (R})."

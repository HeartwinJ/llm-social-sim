You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since my opponent chose B in the previous round and received a 40$ payout while I received nothing, it may be tempting to switch strategies and choose R next time to potentially earn more money. However, since my opponent is unlikely to change their strategy and continue choosing B, it is rational for me to stick with my original choice of B to maximize my earnings. In this case, if my opponent chooses R, I will receive a 40$ payout while my opponent receives nothing. If my opponent chooses B again, we will both receive nothing. Therefore, my chosen strategy is to choose B again."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy allows for a higher potential payoff (45$) when my anonymous opponent chooses the same strategy (R), while still maintaining a reasonable return of 35$ if they choose B. The game having 75 rounds increases the likelihood of a high payout, as the strategy R has a higher average payout (37.5$) compared to strategy B (32.5$).

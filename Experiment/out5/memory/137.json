You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since we don't have any information about the opponent's strategy, we can only base our decision on our own preferences and expected outcomes.\n\nAs a risk-taker and challenger who seeks new experiences, I would opt for a mixed strategy approach, meaning I will not always pick the same choice but rather fluctuate between R and B to maximize my earnings. This strategy is based on the idea that if I consistently pick the same option, my opponent might exploit it, leading to lower earnings overall.\n\nIn this case, picking R provides a higher reward when my opponent picks B (45$ vs 42$), but I stand to lose more compared to picking B when my opponent picks R (0$ vs 12$). Therefore, I would balance the choices by picking R and B with approximately equal frequencies.\n\nIn conclusion, my choice for this game is R{R} as a starting point, but I intend to vary my strategy throughout the 75 rounds based on the outcomes observed along the way."

This new information might lead me to believe that my opponent may be more likely to choose R in the next round. However, since I don't have any data about their strategy or tendencies, I can only make an educated guess.\n\nIn light of this, I will now pick R{R} as my next choice. This decision is based on the assumption that if my opponent tends to choose R more frequently, selecting R myself might lead to a higher payoff in the future rounds.

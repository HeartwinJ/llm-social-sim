You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

For simplicity, let's denote R as +1 and B as 0.\n\n- If I pick R and my opponent picks R, I get a payoff of +45 (2 times 22.5, since the total payout is split between us)\n- If I pick R and my opponent picks B, I get a payoff of -3 (since I get nothing, and they get 42)\n- If I pick B and my opponent picks R, I get a payoff of +38 (since I get 42, and they get nothing)\n- If I pick B and my opponent picks B, I get a payoff of +12\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected payoff for each choice:\n\nFor R, the expected payoff is (number of times R wins against R * payout for R vs. R) + (number of times R wins against B * payout for R vs. B) + (number of ties * payout for ties) = (1 * 45) + (63 * (-3)) + (0 * 12) = -198 - 198 + 0 = -396\n\nFor B, the expected payoff is (number of times B wins against R * payout for B vs. R) + (number of times B wins against B * payout for B vs. B) + (number of ties * payout for ties) = (63 * 38) + (1 * 12) = 2409 + 12 = 2421\n\nGiven that I am comfortable taking risks and want to maximize my expected payoff, I would choose B as my strategy, as it results in a higher expected payoff compared to R.\n\nTherefore, I choose B{B}."

I received a payoff of 12$ while my opponent received a payoff of 12$.\n\nIn this game, since both players chose the same strategy (B), neither player gains or loses anything. To make an informed decision for the next round, let me recalculate the expected payoffs for both choices (R and B) based on the current information:\n\nFor R, the expected payoff is (number of times R wins against R * payout for R vs. R) + (number of times R wins against B * payout for R vs. B) + (number of ties * payout for ties) = (0 * 15) + (63 * -12) + (64 * 0) = -768\n\nFor B, the expected payoff is (number of times B wins against R * payout for B vs. R) + (number of times B wins against B * payout for B vs. B) + (number of ties * payout for ties) = (12 * 15) + (63 * 0) + (64 * 0) = 180\n\nNow let's compare the expected payoffs:\n\n- For R, the expected payoff is -768\n- For B, the expected payoff is 180\n\nIn this case, choosing B would yield a significantly higher expected payoff (180) compared to choosing R (-768). Therefore, as an undergraduate student participating in a lab experiment, I will continue to choose B for the next round.\n\nTherefore, I choose B{B}."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Given the game's payoff structure, if my opponent consistently picks R for high-payoff rounds, they would earn 45$ per round when paired with my B choice, whereas I'd only get 12$. However, by occasionally switching to R, they allow me to capitalize on those instances where their strategy fails.\n\nConversely, if the opponent consistently picks B for high-payoff rounds, they would earn 45$ per round when paired with my R choice, whereas I'd only get 12$. But again, by occasionally switching to B, I give them opportunities to capitalize on their errors.\n\nConsidering the game has 75 rounds and both of us are likely to make mistakes in predicting our opponent's strategy, it makes sense to have a mixed strategy approach: not always pick the same choice but vary it based on the observed patterns from previous rounds. This way, we can exploit any deviations or errors made by the opponent while minimizing potential losses and maximizing opportunities for gains.\n\nIn this case, I choose R as my initial move {R}. But after each round, I will adapt my strategy based on the observed pattern of the opponent's choices, aiming to capitalize on any mistakes they make in their own strategy."

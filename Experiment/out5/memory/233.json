You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since my goal is to maximize my earnings over 75 rounds, I will adopt a dominant strategy approach, assuming that the anonymous player could also be employing a similar strategy.\n\nIn this game, R dominates B in terms of expected value because if both players choose R, they get 45$, which is higher than the payout of 35$ for choosing R when the opponent chooses B. However, if the opponent decides to pick B, I would still prefer R since I get 0$ instead of 35$.\n\nSince we are assuming that my opponent could be employing a similar strategy, it is reasonable to expect that they will also choose R as their dominant strategy. With this assumption, choosing R maximizes my earnings per round (45$) and guarantees a higher payout over the long term compared to choosing B (35$ or 40$).\n\nTherefore, I would choose R {R}."

Your opponent's payoff is 35$.\n\nBy picking R, you lost this round because your opponent picked B. However, your strategy of consistently choosing R ensures that if your opponent ever switches to picking R, you will be better off due to the higher payout for R-R pairings.

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If I assume that my anonymous player is also a rational decision-maker who wants to earn as much money as possible, we might both want to deviate from the simple \"always pick R\" or \"always pick B\" strategies to optimize our earnings.\n\nOne strategy could be to use tit-for-tat, where I start by picking R and then adapt my choice based on the opponent's previous moves. If they stick with R, I will continue to pick R as well since we both earn more that way (45$ each round). However, if they switch to B at some point, I would switch to B in subsequent rounds to encourage them to revert back to R and maximize my earnings. In this strategy, I would occasionally pick R or B depending on the opponent's previous choices.\n\nIn terms of the specific round we are playing now, I would choose R because if the opponent starts by choosing B, I can earn 35$ in this round and then switch to B in future rounds to maximize my earnings over the long term (considering they also follow a similar strategy).

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In a one-time scenario, it might seem beneficial to pick R every time (due to the higher potential reward of 45$ if the opponent also picks R), but in a long game like this, there's a higher probability that the opponent will switch strategies.\n\nWhen considering the payoffs, the difference between choosing R and B when the opponent chooses the opposite is just 3$. However, when both choose the same letter, the difference is 33$ (45$ for R vs 12$ for B). This makes it more advantageous to match the opponent's choice when they pick the same letter.\n\nSo, I would initially try to mimic the opponent's choices to maximize earnings in rounds where we both pick the same letter. However, occasionally switching strategies might be beneficial to catch the opponent off guard and potentially earn 45$ when they least expect it.\n\nIn the end, my choice depends on how well I can predict or influence the opponent's strategy throughout the game, and I would choose a strategy that maximizes my overall earnings over 75 rounds. So, I will pick R for this round (R})."

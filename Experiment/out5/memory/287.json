You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If they choose B while I choose R, I lose the round but still come out ahead in the long run because I get 0$ and they only get 40$. This means that if my opponent consistently picks B when I pick R, I would still be netting a positive difference of 5$ per round. If we both pick B, I earn 20$, which is less than what we could earn together by picking R, but it's not detrimental either because it gives me the opportunity to switch strategies and earn more in future rounds. However, since my opponent can also observe my previous choices and adjust their strategy accordingly, they may attempt to exploit this behavior. Nonetheless, I still believe that my initial choice of R {R} would be beneficial overall given my aggressive approach towards risk-taking and the long-term potential for profit."

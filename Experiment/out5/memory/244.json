You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this particular game, the strategy that maximizes my earnings over the long run is to choose 'R'.\n\nHere's why:\n- If my opponent chooses 'B', I will earn 40$ in each of the 75 rounds, which amounts to a total of 3000$.\n- The worst-case scenario happens when both of us choose 'R' in every round. In this case, we each get 45$ per round, but since there are 75 rounds, I will earn 3375$, which is still better than choosing 'B'.\n- However, the most likely outcome is that my opponent will mix up their choices and select 'R' on some occasions. In this case, I would win more money because of the larger payout for a correct guess (45$ vs 20$).\n\nSo, considering these factors, I would choose 'R' in this game as it offers a better long-term payoff.\n\n{R}"

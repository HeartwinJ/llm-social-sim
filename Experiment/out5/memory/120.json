You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both R and B have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nIf I choose R consistently (every round), I stand to gain 45$ in each round where my opponent chooses R, but lose 0$ in every round they pick B. However, the average payoff per round over the course of 75 rounds is not guaranteed, considering the anonymity of the opponent and their potential strategy.\n\nIf I choose B consistently (every round), I stand to gain 40$ in each round, but forfeit the higher potential win of 45$ if my opponent picks R in any given round. The average payoff per round over the course of 75 rounds is more predictable in this scenario.\n\nTo optimize my strategy, I would consider adopting a mixed strategy\u2014varying my choices between R and B.

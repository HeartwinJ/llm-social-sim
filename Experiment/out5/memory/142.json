You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, it seems that picking 'R' consistently could lead to a higher average payoff if my opponent is also taking similar risks (picking 'R' often as well). However, since we don't know each other's strategies, I would consider mixing up my choices to potentially exploit any patterns in their strategy.\n\nIn a 75-round game, it could be beneficial to pick 'R' more frequently at the start to capitalize on the higher payoff (45$) when we both choose 'R', and then adjust my strategy based on the results observed so far. This approach would involve some level of risk but also offers a chance for significant rewards.\n\nThat being said, it is crucial to remember that I am making this choice as a human player with limited information about my opponent's strategy, and this decision-making process may not always lead to the optimal outcome due to unforeseen circumstances or factors beyond my control.\n\nAs a result, I will choose 'R' for the initial rounds of the game and adjust my strategy based on the observed patterns in my opponent's choices.

This decision takes into account the initial loss in the first round and aims to mitigate it by attempting to earn a positive payoff in subsequent rounds.\n\nHowever, it is essential to remember that my opponent might be doing the same thing - adjusting their strategy based on the outcome of our previous interaction.

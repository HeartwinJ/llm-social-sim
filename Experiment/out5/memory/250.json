You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The strategy here is to maximize my potential winnings while also considering that the anonymous player might be making similar calculations.\n\nSince both choices have some level of uncertainty, it's important to consider the long-term payoff. If I stick to choice R and the other player does the same, we will each earn 45$ per round. If they switch their strategy midway, I can still gain an advantage by sticking with my choice.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, if they consistently pick B while I pick R, I would lose in 75 rounds (since I get 0$ for 75 rounds and earn 40$ in the remaining rounds), but my total earnings would still be 1,500$. On the other hand, if they stick with choice R while I switch to B halfway through, I could potentially gain more than 2,375$, which is the total payoff from both strategies combined.\n\nBy choosing {R}, I'm aiming for a situation where we both pick R consistently or where my flexibility to change strategy allows me to capitalize on any potential miscalculation by the other player. However, this choice assumes that the other player is rational and making similar calculations as well."

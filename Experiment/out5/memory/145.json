You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since they get 42$ when I pick R and they win, and only 12$ if we both pick B, it's reasonable to assume that they will favor picking R as much as possible.\n\nHowever, if they always choose R, my best strategy would be to consistently pick B in the first 74 rounds so that I can earn 74 * 12 + 12 = $896 (assuming they do not change their strategy), and then switch to picking R on the final round to secure a payoff of 45$.\n\nOn the other hand, if my opponent is intelligent and understands this strategy, they might adapt by occasionally choosing B to maximize their own potential for winning the last round. In that case, I would have to consider their patterns and make decisions accordingly.\n\nIn practice, it's impossible to predict an opponent's exact strategy, but considering the high probability that my opponent will favor picking R, I would choose to pick B in this game {B}."

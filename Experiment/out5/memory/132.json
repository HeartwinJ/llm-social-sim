You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player, I would approach this game strategically to maximize my potential earnings. Given that the game consists of 75 rounds, it's important to consider the long-term payoff rather than focusing on individual round outcomes.\n\nLet's analyze the possible choices:\n\n1) Choosing R consistently (R_R): If both players choose R in every round, they each earn 45$ per round. Over 75 rounds, that would be 3,375$ for me and 3,375$ for my opponent.\n\n2) Choosing B consistently (B_B): If both players choose B in every round, they each earn 40$ per round. Over 75 rounds, that would be 3,000$ for me and 3,000$ for my opponent.\n\n3) Alternating choices (R_B, B_R): In this strategy, a player chooses R when the round number is odd and B when it's even. This way, they get 35$ every other round and 40$ in the remaining rounds. Over 75 rounds, that would be 2,915$ for me and 2,915$ for my opponent (assuming the first round is an even number).\n\nLooking at these options, alternating choices result in a slightly lower payout than consistently choosing B, but it provides more unpredictability. This could potentially lead my anonymous opponent to make suboptimal decisions when trying to predict my moves. As I am comfortable taking risks and embracing new challenges, I might choose the R_B strategy (R_B_human). However, it is important to note that this decision is based on assumptions about the behavior of my opponent, which could be wrong in practice."

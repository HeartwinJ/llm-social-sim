You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this strategy, I will start by choosing R on my first move, aiming to cooperate and get the highest possible payoff of 45$ (if the other player also chooses R).\n\nAfter that, I will mimic their previous move for the next several rounds. If they continue to play fairly and choose R, we both will keep earning 45$ per round. However, if they choose B in any round, I will immediately switch my strategy and respond with B in all future rounds as well (since they are taking advantage of my cooperation).\n\nFor this game with 75 rounds, the optimal strategy would be to start with R and then adapt to the other player's moves. This approach maximizes our earnings while also punishing any unfair moves made by the opponent. I will choose: {R}"

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

By choosing R, I have the chance to earn 45$ if my opponent also chooses R, which is a significant reward. If my opponent chooses B, I will still have a slight advantage by earning 0$ less than them (40$ instead of 45$). This strategy is based on the assumption that, given the potential for higher rewards, my opponent may be more likely to also take risks and choose R as well.

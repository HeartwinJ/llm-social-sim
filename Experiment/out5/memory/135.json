You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The key here is to minimize losses while maximizing potential gains.\n\nIn this game, choosing R{R} might seem attractive due to the higher payout in some scenarios (45$ each round). However, if my opponent also chooses R consistently, we both end up with 0$ for every fourth round. That's a significant loss considering there are 75 rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing B{B} guarantees us 40$ per round in scenarios where our opponent also picks B. Additionally, when our opponent picks R and we pick B, we still make a profit of 35$. This means that even if my opponent occasionally chooses R, I can still benefit from the game.\n\nTherefore, I believe that consistently choosing B{B} is a rational choice in this game due to its ability to minimize losses and still profit in most scenarios."

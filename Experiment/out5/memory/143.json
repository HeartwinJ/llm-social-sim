You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since we don't know our opponent's strategy, it is essential to consider potential outcomes and adjust the strategy accordingly.\n\nIn a situation where the goal is to maximize earnings over 75 rounds, let's analyze both choices (R and B) based on their potential outcomes:\n\n1. R: If the opponent chooses the same as me (R), we each earn 45$. However, if the opponent chooses B, I will lose 3$ per round for the 75 rounds, totaling a loss of 225$.\n\n2. B: If the opponent chooses the same as me (B), we each earn 12$ per round, totaling 900$ over 75 rounds. However, if the opponent chooses R, I will gain 3$ per round for the 75 rounds, totaling 225$.\n\nIn this case, choosing B seems more profitable in the long run, regardless of the opponent's strategy, as it provides a better average outcome when compared to R.

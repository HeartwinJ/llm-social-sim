If I pick R and my opponent picks B, I get 0$. The probability of this happening is dependent on their strategy, but let's assume they also choose R and B equally (50-50). So, the expected value for choosing R when my opponent picks B is 0$ * 0.5 = -$0.5 per round.\n2. If I pick R and my opponent also picks R, we each get 45$. The probability of this happening is also dependent on their strategy, but let's assume the same 50-50 chance as above. So, the expected value for choosing R when my opponent also picks R is 45$ * 0.5 = $22.5 per round.\n3. If I pick B and my opponent picks R, I get 35$. The probability of this happening is again based on their strategy, so the expected value for choosing B when my opponent picks R is 35$ * 0.5 = $17.5 per round.\n4. If I pick B and my opponent also picks B, we each get 40$. Using the same assumption as above, the expected value for choosing B when my opponent also picks B is 40$ * 0.5 = $20 per round.\n\nNow let's calculate the total expected value for each move over 75 rounds:\n\n1. Choosing R: -$0.5 per round * 75 rounds = -$37.5\n2. Choosing B: $17.5 per round * 75 rounds + (-$0.5 per round * 37.5 rounds) = $1,312.5 - $18.75 = $1,303.75\n\nSince choosing B results in a higher total expected value over the 75 rounds, I would choose B as my move. So, my final choice is {B}. However, it's essential to keep in mind that this calculation assumes that my opponent chooses R and B equally, which might not be accurate, making the actual outcome uncertain."

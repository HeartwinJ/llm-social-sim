You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy is based on the assumption that the anonymous player might be rational as well, and if they are, they will observe our payoff patterns over time. After some rounds, they might realize that choosing B when I choose R results in them receiving a higher payout (35$) than when we both pick R (40$). Therefore, it's more advantageous for them to pick R, and the same logic applies to me as well. By consistently picking R, I aim to encourage my opponent to do the same, maximizing my potential earnings in the long run. However, there is always a chance that the other player might not be rational or follow this line of thinking, leading to an unpredictable outcome."

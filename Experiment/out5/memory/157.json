You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy allows me to potentially earn more in each round compared to choosing B, especially if I believe that the anonymous player might also be a risk-taker like myself. However, there's a higher chance of earning less or even nothing in some rounds due to the other player choosing B. Overall, by consistently picking R, I hope to accumulate more wealth over the 75 rounds as compared to choosing B consistently. It's essential to remember that this game is based on probability and psychology, so the outcome might not always be predictable."

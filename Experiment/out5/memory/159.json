You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, I would choose a strategy called Tit-for-Tat, which is a popular strategy in repeated games. In this strategy, I would start by choosing R (cooperate) on the first round, and then mimic my opponent's move from the previous round on subsequent rounds.\n\nIn terms of specific choices, if I believe that my opponent will also adopt a Tit-for-Tat strategy, it is advantageous to choose R as my initial move because the potential for a higher reward (45$) in the long run outweighs the immediate loss (0$) in the first round. However, since I don't know my opponent's strategy and this is an anonymous game, I can only make an educated guess based on the payoff structure and general game theory principles.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be: {R}"

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In a long-term game with 75 rounds, it seems more beneficial to consistently pick one strategy (R), because when my opponent picks B and I pick R, I will get 0$ in that round but have the potential for higher payouts in subsequent rounds where they might switch their strategy.\n\nConsidering the expected payoff for each strategy:\n- If my opponent picks B every time, I'd earn an average of 12$ per round over 75 rounds, with a total earning of $900.\n- However, if my opponent randomly switches their strategy (which is likely given the nature of the game), I might be able to exploit that and gain a higher payout in certain rounds. By consistently picking R, I could potentially earn more than $900 if my opponent picks B frequently enough when it benefits me.\n\nIn short, choosing strategy R allows for potential greater earnings by taking advantage of any unpredictability or randomness in my opponent's strategy and maximizing the payoff when they pick B. {R}"

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If I consistently pick R (or B), and the other player does the opposite (always picks B or R respectively), they will earn more in the long run because of the 3$ advantage in their favor on each round where we pick differently. However, if I occasionally switch my strategy to match theirs (pick R when they picked B, and vice versa), I can potentially catch up and even surpass them due to the higher payout for matching choices.\n\n2. If both players adopt a random strategy, it's unpredictable whether one will earn more over the 75 rounds.\n\nSince I am comfortable taking risks, I would choose to follow a strategy that occasionally switches my choice based on the results of previous rounds. This way, I can potentially capitalize on the higher payout for matching choices while also minimizing the disadvantage in the long run due to the 3$ difference in payouts when our choices differ.\n\nMy choice would be to randomly pick R or B, depending on the outcome of the previous rounds. I will append my choice as follows: {R} (or possibly {B}, based on the results of previous rounds)."

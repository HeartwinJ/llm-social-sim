You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player who is comfortable with taking risks, I would analyze this game strategically to maximize my expected earnings over the 75 rounds.\n\nIn each round, there are two possible outcomes: R vs R (RR) or B vs R (BR). The payoff for both scenarios is not symmetrical; when we pick R and they pick B, we get nothing while they earn 42$. To counteract this disadvantage, I would need to ensure that the overall number of times I choose R outweighs the instances where I choose B.\n\nLet's calculate the expected payoff for both choices:\n\n1. If I pick R consistently (75 rounds), the worst-case scenario is when my opponent always picks B. In this case, I earn 0$ in 75 rounds.\n\n2. If I pick B consistently (75 rounds), the worst-case scenario is when my opponent always picks R. In this case, I earn 12$ in each of the 75 rounds, for a total of 900$.\n\nHowever, since there's no way to know for certain what my anonymous opponent will do, we can't rely solely on these worst-case scenarios. To make an informed decision, let's consider the expected value of each choice:\n\n1. If I pick R consistently (75 rounds), the expected value is 0$ * P(they pick B) + 45$ * P(they pick R) = 0$ * (1-P(they pick R)) + 45$ * P(they pick R)\n\nSince they can pick either R or B, P(they pick R) + P(they pick B) = 1, so we can rewrite this as:\n\n   Expected Value of R = 0$ * (1 - P(R)) + 45$ * P(R)\n                     = 45$ * P(R) - 45$\n\n2. If I pick B consistently (75 rounds), the expected value is 12$ * P(they pick R) + 0$ * P(they pick B) = 12$ * P(they pick R)\n\nSince the payoff for picking B is lower than that of picking R when my opponent picks B, I would need a higher probability that they pick R to make up for this disadvantage. In this case, let's say I believe there's a 50% chance (P(R) = 0.5).\n\nNow we can compare the expected values:\n\n   Expected Value of R = 45$ * 0.5 - 45$ = -10$\n   Expected Value of B = 12$ * 0.5 = 6$\n\nThe expected value of picking R is negative, meaning that, on average, I would lose money if I pick R consistently. However, the expected value of picking B is positive, meaning that, on average, I would make a profit if I pick B consistently. Therefore, based on these calculations and my preference for taking risks, I would choose to play B in this game to maximize my expected earnings over the 75 rounds.\n\nAppend my choice letter: {B}"

In this game, choosing R is more profitable when my opponent chooses B (42$ vs 0$). However, if both of us choose R, we both earn less than if we both chose B.\n\nGiven that it's a repeated game with 75 rounds, I would consider the long-term benefits and try to establish a strategy for maximizing my earnings in the long run. Since there is no guarantee about my opponent's behavior, I could choose to alternate between R and B to increase the chances of earning more money overall.\n\nHowever, since it's an anonymous player, I might consider exploiting them by choosing R when I believe they will likely pick B (based on their past choices or assumed risk-taking behavior). On the other hand, if my opponent is rational and understands this strategy, they might respond with a counter-strategy.\n\nUltimately, it depends on whether I want to maximize immediate payoff or focus on long-term earnings. In this case, I would choose R occasionally to maintain uncertainty and keep my options open for adapting my strategy as the game progresses.\n\nSo, in curly brackets, my choice would be {R}.

You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$.

While there is a chance that my opponent might consistently pick B, which could result in a lower payoff for me, the potential high reward (45$ per round) when we both choose R outweighs the risk of low or no rewards in certain rounds.\n\nIn 75 rounds, I expect that there will be more instances where my opponent chooses R than B, given that the payoff is higher when we both pick R compared to B. The strategy of always picking R (also known as a dominant strategy) can potentially lead to more high-reward outcomes and an overall higher average payout.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that since my opponent is anonymous, I have no information about their strategies or tendencies, so there's some element of uncertainty involved.

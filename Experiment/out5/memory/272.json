You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The higher potential reward of 45$ (for both of us) when we both pick R, outweighs the risk of getting 0$ if they pick B. However, I am aware that there's a chance we might lose some rounds where both of us choose R and get only 20$, but overall, I believe that the higher reward in more cases will bring a better outcome in the long run (75 rounds). Of course, if I knew for certain that my opponent would always pick B, then it would make sense to switch strategies. But since we are anonymous players, there's no way to know their exact strategy beforehand."

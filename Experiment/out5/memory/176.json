You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

On the other hand, choosing 'B' guarantees a consistent 12$ per round, albeit with a lower maximum potential gain.\n\nHowever, since this is a repeated game and I am comfortable taking risks, I would consider trying to exploit my opponent's possible strategy. If my opponent tends to choose 'R', then choosing 'B' in the first few rounds could make them switch to 'B' more often, which would benefit me in the long run due to the higher payoff for 'R'.\n\nAlso, since I am playing against an anonymous player, there is no guarantee that they will stick to a specific strategy throughout the game. Thus, it might be beneficial to mix up my choices to make it harder for them to predict my move and potentially take advantage of it.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would opt for a mixed strategy where I alternate between 'R' and 'B' to maximize my potential earnings while minimizing the risk of consistently earning 0$. {R} (I will start with R on the first round)"

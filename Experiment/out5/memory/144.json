You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If I always pick R (RRRR...), my opponent picks B in response once, and they will get 35$ for that round while I get nothing. In the remaining 74 rounds, we both get 45$. So my total payoff would be (74 * 45) + (-35) = $3290 - $35 = $3287.\n\n2. If I always pick R (RRRR...), my opponent decides to also play R and we both get 45$ for each of the 75 rounds. So my total payoff would be 75 * 45 = $3375.\n\n3. If I switch to playing B in response to their R, and they do the same (BBBB...), we both earn 40$ for each of the 75 rounds. My total payoff would be 75 * 40 = $3000.\n\n4. If I always pick B (BBBB...), my opponent picks R in response once, and they will get 35$ for that round while I get nothing. In the remaining 74 rounds, we both get 40$. So my total payoff would be (74 * 40) + (-35) = $2960 - $35 = $2925.\n\nGiven my risk-taking nature and the potential for a higher reward in the case where my opponent decides to play R as well, I would choose to stick with R (R). The probability that we both pick R is 1/4 for each round, but since there are 75 rounds, the expected number of times we both pick R is approximately 18.75. If this occurs, my total payoff would be significantly higher than the other strategies, with an expected value of (75 - 18.75) * 45 + 18.75 * 0 = $2679.25, which is more attractive compared to the other strategies.\n\n{R}"

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The payoff for both R and B seems to favor R when played against a random opponent, given that R yields a higher average return (45$ vs 35$ in the worst-case scenario).\n\nIn the long run of 75 rounds, it is more likely that I will get closer to the best possible outcome (which is 45$ per round) by playing R compared to B. Additionally, the payoff difference between both strategies becomes less significant as the number of rounds increases. This strategy also allows for a greater potential upside if my opponent tends to choose R more frequently due to their own risk preferences or strategic reasoning.\n\nHowever, it is essential to remember that this is just one possible approach and does not guarantee a specific outcome, given the uncertainty in the opponent's choice. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual preferences and risk tolerance."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, considering the game has 75 rounds, there is a high chance that both players may adjust their strategies over time.\n\nIn a one-time scenario, choosing R would be more beneficial because of the higher payout when both players pick different choices. But since this is a repeated game, I might also consider mixing my strategy to avoid being exploited by an opponent who anticipates my consistent choice of R. So, while my primary choice would be R, I may occasionally switch to B to keep my strategy unpredictable and potentially maximize my overall payoff in the long run.\n\nIn this context, I choose R{R} as my initial move, but with the understanding that I might adjust my strategy based on the opponent's response."

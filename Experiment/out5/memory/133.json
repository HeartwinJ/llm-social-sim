You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, picking R seems to be a riskier move because it results in zero payout when my opponent picks B. However, when they pick R as well, we both get 45$.\n\nOn the other hand, picking B guarantees a consistent payout of 40$ every time my opponent chooses R, and we both get 40$ when they also pick B. The difference in earnings between these two outcomes (45$ versus 40$) is only 5$, but it happens less frequently.\n\nGiven the repeated nature of the game with 75 rounds, I would lean towards picking B more often to minimize the risk and ensure a consistent payout while aiming for the higher reward whenever possible. Therefore, my choice would be {B}. However, it's essential to note that this strategy assumes that the opponent is also rational and will adjust their strategy accordingly. In reality, they might not, leading to unexpected results."

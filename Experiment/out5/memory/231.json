You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since I don't know the strategy of my anonymous partner, I will need to consider a mix of strategies.\n\nI believe that if I consistently pick R (Risky strategy), there is a chance that my partner might catch on and start picking B more often in response, potentially lowering my earnings. On the other hand, if I pick B (Conservative strategy) more frequently, I would secure a more stable income of 40$ per round, but at the cost of missing out on potential higher payoffs if my partner also picks B.\n\nConsidering these factors and taking advantage of my risk-taking nature, I will choose R as my first move in this game (R{R}). But it is important to note that adapting my strategy based on the results of each round would be essential for optimizing my earnings throughout the 75 rounds."

If I continue choosing B, there is a chance that my partner and I could maintain our pattern of higher payoffs (35$) by both selecting B again in the next round. However, if either of us deviates from this pattern by selecting R, we would both potentially receive lower payoffs.\n\nTo maximize my potential earnings in this experiment, it seems that continuing to choose B is a better option for now since doing so maintains the current higher payoff (35$) and leaves open the possibility of even higher future payoffs if my partner also chooses B. Therefore, I will choose B for the next round. My decision will be appended as follows: B{B}."

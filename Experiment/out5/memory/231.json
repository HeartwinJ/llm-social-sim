If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$.

If my opponent consistently picks R, it's beneficial for me to pick B in every round to maximize my earnings since they will earn 0$ when I pick R and get only 40$ when we both pick B. However, this strategy might not be optimal as my opponent may eventually realize that I am exploiting their strategy and adjust their own accordingly.\n2. If my opponent consistently picks B, it's beneficial for me to pick R in every round, as I will earn 35$ each time they pick R, while we both earn 40$ when we both pick B. Again, this may not be the best long-term strategy since an intelligent opponent might adjust their play.\n3. A mixed strategy would involve picking R and B in a random or patterned manner to make it harder for my opponent to predict my choice. This approach could potentially maximize earnings over 75 rounds by preventing my opponent from exploiting any specific pattern.\n\nGiven that I am comfortable with taking risks, I would opt for the mixed strategy, as it offers the potential for higher earnings in the long run while maintaining a level of unpredictability to deter any attempts at exploitation by my opponent.\n\nMy choice would be: {R or B randomly}"

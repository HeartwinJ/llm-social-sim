However, the probability of both us choosing 'R' in each round is not specified, and since this is a repeated game over 75 rounds, there could be strategies that involve changing choices to maximize earnings.\n\nAs a risk-taker, I might consider picking 'R' for a few rounds to see if my opponent follows suit or switches to 'B'. If they switch to 'B', then I can adjust my strategy accordingly. However, since the number of rounds is known (75), my opponent could potentially use this information to their advantage by adopting a specific strategy that takes into account the length of the game.\n\nIn the end, without knowing more about my opponent's potential strategies or their behavior, I would lean towards picking 'R' initially and adjusting my strategy based on my opponent's responses, but ultimately, the optimal choice could vary depending on factors such as the opponent's expected behavior and the overall goal of the game (e.g., maximizing total earnings or winning as many rounds as possible).\n\nSo, in curly brackets: {R} - I would start with 'R' and adapt my strategy based on the opponent's responses."

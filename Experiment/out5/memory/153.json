You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Although there is a chance that I might lose some rounds where they pick B, the potential for higher returns when they also pick R outweighs the losses. In the long run, the additional 5$ per round (R vs B payoff) accumulates to a significant amount, making it more likely for me to earn more overall compared to picking B consistently. However, I would understand that this is a game with an element of unpredictability and acknowledge that there's no guarantee of victory."

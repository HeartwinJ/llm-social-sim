You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, if I always pick R, and the anonymous player does the same, we would both get 45$ for every round where we both pick R. However, there is a risk that the other player might not follow the same strategy and could choose B, resulting in me getting 0$ while they get 42$.\n\nGiven my risk-taking nature, I would choose to play this game as follows: I will start by picking R in the first round (let's call it R_{1}). If the other player responds with R, we both get 45$ for that round. If they pick B, I switch my strategy immediately and start picking B consistently from then on (let's say B_{2} to B_{75}), ensuring a minimum payoff of 12$ per round.\n\nIf the other player follows my lead and switches to B after seeing my R, I will switch back to R for the remaining rounds, aiming to maximize our collective earnings by getting 45$ in those rounds. If they don't switch and continue picking B, I will still get a minimum payoff of 12$ per round.\n\nSo, my choice is R_{1} (with R as the last character)."

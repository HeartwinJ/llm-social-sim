You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if my opponent consistently picks R, they are better off with B, and vice versa. Since there are 75 rounds, the game's outcome will likely not be determined by chance alone, but rather by a pattern that may emerge over time. By choosing R, I have the potential to win more in individual rounds (45$ versus 35$), even though there is a risk of losing in some rounds (0$). However, my overall winnings could still be higher due to the greater potential reward per round. Therefore, I choose R{}."

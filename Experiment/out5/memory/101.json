You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because the potential for greater rewards in the cases where my opponent chooses B makes it an attractive option for me, even though there is a higher chance of earning zero in some rounds. Over the course of 75 rounds, the strategy that maximizes the expected value would likely be to switch between R and B at some point to minimize the likelihood of always receiving zero payout. However, as a human player, I might not follow this optimal strategy exactly due to factors like emotions, fatigue, or irrationality that could influence my decisions in each round."

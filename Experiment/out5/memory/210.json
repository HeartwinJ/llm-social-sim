You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy is based on the idea that if my opponent follows a similar risk-taking approach, we will both benefit from choosing 'R' when our choices match. Additionally, if my opponent tends to choose 'B', I will still earn a decent return (35$) for every round in which they make this choice. While the payoff for both 'R' and 'B' is not equal, the higher potential reward of 45$ makes it an attractive option when considering the long-term outcome over 75 rounds."

In this case, let's consider an \"average\" opponent who might choose R or B with equal probability (50-50).\n\nTo analyze this, let's calculate the expected payoff for each choice:\n\n1. Choosing R:\n   - If opponent chooses R (25% chance), we both get 45$, so our net gain is 45$ - 45$ = 0$.\n   - If opponent chooses B (50% chance), we get 0$, and they get 42$, so our net loss is -42$.\n   - If we assume that the opponent will choose B in half of the remaining cases, we get a net gain of 45$ in these scenarios.\n   - Therefore, the expected value for choosing R is (0% * 0$) + (50% * (-42$)) + (50% * 45$) = -18$.\n\n2. Choosing B:\n   - If opponent chooses R (25% chance), we get 42$, and they get 0$, so our net gain is 42$.\n   - If opponent chooses B (50% chance), we both earn 12$, so our net gain is 12$ - 12$ = 0$.\n   - In the remaining cases, assuming equal probability, we get a net loss of 42$ for each.\n   - Therefore, the expected value for choosing B is (0% * 0$) + (50% * 0$) + (25% * (-42$)) + (25% * 42$) = 0$.\n\nIt's clear that choosing R has a negative expected payoff, while choosing B has a neutral expected payoff. Since I prefer higher potential earnings, especially when the risk is spread over multiple rounds and considering my opponent might be random, I would choose B in this scenario (B{})."

The reason for this is that if my opponent follows a random strategy (50-50 chance of choosing R or B), there's a 50% chance that they chose R in the previous round, and a 50% chance that they chose B. Since we both chose B last time, I expect them to choose R this time. If my assumption is correct, I will earn 45$, which is a better outcome compared to earning 12$ again by sticking with the same strategy (BB{}).\n\nHowever, if my opponent also switches their strategy based on my previous choice, they might choose B in this round as well, resulting in both of us earning 12$. In this case, we can continue switching strategies back and forth to earn 12$ each round. Since the game is only for 75 rounds, it would not make sense to engage in such a strategy as the potential earnings are low compared to the number of rounds played.

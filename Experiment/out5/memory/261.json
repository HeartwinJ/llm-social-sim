To further increase our chances of earning even higher payoffs, we can introduce randomness or variations into our choice patterns (e.g., mix B and R choices) to make it harder for each other to predict our next move.

This outcome occurs because choosing B results in the same payoff for both players regardless of their opponent's choice (R or B).\n\n1. If we continue to pick B in future rounds, our payoffs will remain constant at 12$. However, it may be possible to achieve higher payoffs if one player is willing to take a risk and switch their strategy from picking B to picking R in an attempt to exploit the other player's cooperation. This demonstrates that even in games where there are no dominant strategies, there can still be opportunities for strategic behavior.\n2. In this game, mutual cooperation (choosing B) does not necessarily lead to the best outcome for both players, as they could potentially achieve a higher payoff by taking risks and adopting different strategies. It's important to consider the potential costs and benefits of various strategies before making a decision.\n3. Lastly, it's worth noting that the specific payoffs in this game may affect the optimal strategy, so it is essential to thoroughly understand the details of the game before making any decisions.\n\nIn summary, this scenario highlights how even in games where there are no dominant strategies, strategic behavior can still lead to better outcomes for one or both players.

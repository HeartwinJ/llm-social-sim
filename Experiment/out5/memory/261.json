You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If both players consistently pick the same strategy (either R or B), they will both earn 45$ for each round where they choose the same strategy and 12$ for each round where they choose different strategies. This means that in a best-case scenario, a player can earn 3300$ (75 rounds * 45$).\n\n2. However, if the opponent is using a mixed strategy, there is a chance that I might end up with 0$ for some rounds. In this case, it's essential to consider the expected value of each strategy and how they compare to each other.\n\n3. Let's denote the probability that the opponent chooses R as p, where 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1. If I choose R, my expected payoff per round is 45p + (1-p)*0 = 45p$. Conversely, if I choose B, my expected payoff per round is 12p + (1-p)*42 = 27p + 42.\n\n4. Since I aim to maximize my earnings, I should go with the strategy that provides a higher expected value in each round. To do this, I need to find the difference between the expected payoffs for both strategies and ensure it's positive: 45p - (27p + 42) = 18p - 42.\n\n5. For this expression to be positive for any value of p, we need (18p - 42) > 0 => p > 0.23611107 (rounded to 6 decimal places). Since it's always possible that the opponent chooses R with a probability greater than 0.23611107, I should go with strategy {R} as it provides a higher expected value per round in this case.\n\nBy choosing strategy {R}, there is a chance of earning less for some rounds, but the potential for higher earnings during other rounds makes up for it. As a risk-taker, I'm willing to accept that uncertainty and aim for the best possible outcome, even though it involves potential loss."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' has a higher reward (45$) compared to choosing 'B' (either 0$ or 20$). However, if the other player often chooses 'R', I may lose money in most rounds by picking 'R'.\n\nOn the flip side, if the other player tends to choose 'B', then I could potentially earn more by frequently choosing 'R' myself. Since the game has 75 rounds, it is likely that if the other player often picks 'B', I can accumulate some winnings over time.\n\nHowever, since I don't know the other player's behavior, my optimal strategy would be to use a mixed strategy where I don't always pick 'R' or 'B'. This way, I can capitalize on situations where the other player chooses 'B' more frequently while also minimizing losses when they choose 'R' more often.\n\nGiven these considerations and my risk-tolerant personality, I would choose R as my initial move (R}). But I would also be prepared to adjust my strategy based on the observed behavior of the other player throughout the game."

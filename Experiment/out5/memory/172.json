If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$.

In this game, picking 'R' has a higher reward (45$) compared to 'B' (20$ or 40$, depending on the opponent's choice) when played against an opponent who also picks 'R'.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that if both players always choose 'R', they will each earn 45$ per round for 75 rounds, which totals 3375$. On the other hand, if both players always choose 'B', they will each earn 1500$.\n\nSince I am an undergraduate student participating in a lab experiment and I understand that this is a one-time game, my best strategy would be to assume the opponent also wants to maximize their earnings. In that case, it's more likely that we both have a mixed strategy \u2013 picking 'R' and 'B' with different probabilities.\n\nTo make the most out of this situation, I would choose 'R' in some rounds, giving me an opportunity to earn 45$ when my opponent also picks 'R'. At the same time, I would mix 'B' in a sufficient number of rounds to capitalize on the higher payoffs (40$) when my opponent chooses 'R', and the guaranteed 20$ when they choose 'B'.\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose both R and B, but with a slightly higher probability for R. {R} - however, it's essential to keep in mind that my strategy can change based on new information or observations about the opponent's behavior during the game."

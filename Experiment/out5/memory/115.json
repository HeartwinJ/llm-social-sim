You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this repeated game, we have multiple opportunities to adjust our strategies based on past outcomes. The game appears to be a form of the Stag Hunt game, where cooperation (picking B) results in a slightly higher payoff but is less profitable if the other player defects (picks R).\n\nHowever, since I am comfortable with taking risks, I would consider a mixed strategy approach by occasionally deviating from the dominant strategy of always choosing B. This could potentially exploit the opponent's expectation that I will always choose B and lead to instances where they pick R, allowing me to gain 35$ instead of 40$.\n\nIn practice, this means that I would randomly select either R or B for each round, with a slight bias towards B since it offers a higher expected payoff when the other player cooperates. Nevertheless, I am prepared for the possibility of an opponent who also adopts such a strategy, which could lead to unpredictable outcomes and a lower overall expected payoff compared to always choosing B.\n\nIn conclusion, I would make a choice based on a mixed strategy, where R and B are selected with approximately equal probability, but with a slight bias towards B due to its higher potential payoff when the other player cooperates. My final choice is: R or B, depending on the specific round and the random number generator used for my strategy. {R}"

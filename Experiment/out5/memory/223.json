You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason behind this is that even though there is a chance of losing rounds where they pick B and I pick R (and earning 0$), the potential for higher gains when they also pick R (earning 45$) outweighs the losses. Over the course of 75 rounds, it's more likely that the gains from both choosing R will accumulate significantly compared to the losses, especially since choosing B yields only a small payout of 12$.

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$.

This is because if my opponent chooses R (which happens 50% of the time on average), I earn 45$ for each round we both pick R. However, if they choose B, I still have a chance to earn 42$ per round.\n\nOn the other hand, if I consistently choose B, my best-case scenario is earning 12$ per round when my opponent also chooses B. But in all other cases, I will earn less than my opponent. So, while there's a chance that my opponent might exploit me by choosing B more often, the expected value of choosing R seems higher.\n\nHowever, this is a simplified analysis and doesn't take into account potential patterns or strategies my opponent might use. In real-world scenarios, it would be wise to monitor my opponent's choices and adjust strategy accordingly. But for the sake of simplicity in this question, I would choose R consistently ({R}) as my strategy."

Since I'm an undergraduate student who is comfortable taking risks and embracing new challenges, sticking to my chosen strategy shows commitment and conviction in my decision-making.\n3.

I might believe that my opponent is randomly choosing their moves or has a tendency to choose B more often, especially if they haven't shown any patterns yet.\n5.

This outcome demonstrates that when we make different choices (R vs. B), I earn nothing while my opponent receives the highest possible payout of 42$ for choosing B when I picked R.\n\nThis outcome serves as a reminder that, even though we have been consistently earning 45$ per round by both picking R, there is still a risk involved in this game as making the wrong choice (B) can lead to a significant loss of payoff. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the potential consequences and probabilities associated with each decision when playing this game.\n\nFor the next round, I will continue choosing ({R}) while remaining open to adjustments if necessary based on my opponent's responses and overall progress in the game.

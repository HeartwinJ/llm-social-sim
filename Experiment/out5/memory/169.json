You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

While there is a chance that I could end up with 0$ if my opponent consistently picks B, I believe the potential rewards outweigh the risks, especially over the course of 75 rounds. The average expected payoff for this strategy, considering all possible outcomes, seems favorable compared to choosing B consistently. However, it's essential to remember that the opponent's strategy is unknown, and they might also be taking risks. This game could result in various interesting dynamics!"

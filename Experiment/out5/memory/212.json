You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason behind this is that while there is a possibility of losing rounds where both players choose differently, the potential gains are significantly higher when we both choose R (45$ per round) compared to B (35$ per round if the opponent chooses R and 40$ per round if they choose B). Moreover, in the long run, I believe that the high reward of 45$ per round outweighs the occasional losses. This strategy maximizes my expected payoff for the 75 rounds, assuming an unpredictable opponent."

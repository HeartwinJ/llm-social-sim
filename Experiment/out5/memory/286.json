You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

However, since there are 75 rounds, it is likely that one of us will deviate from this choice at least once to maximize their own earnings, even if they don't care about the overall outcome as much as I do.\n\nIf I consistently pick R and my opponent picks B once, they will earn 42$ for that round, but over the entire game, I will still make more money (assuming no additional deviations from the R choice) due to the higher payout in rounds where we both pick R.\n\nOn the other hand, if my opponent consistently picks B and I pick R just once, they will earn 45$ for that round, but over the entire game, I will still make more money (assuming no additional deviations from the B choice) because of the higher payout in rounds where we both pick R.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems rational to choose R consistently, as it provides a higher potential earnings over the long term despite the risk of occasional lower payouts in individual rounds. So, my choice would be {R}. However, keep in mind that this reasoning assumes that I don't have any information about my opponent's strategy or behavior. In reality, understanding and anticipating my opponent's actions could potentially lead to a different decision."

One possible solution is to mix my choices between R and B more evenly to increase the chances of earning a non-zero outcome in future rounds. So, for the next round, I might choose {B} to decrease the likelihood of continuing with a strategy that consistently results in a loss when my opponent chooses B. It's important to keep in mind that there is still some uncertainty about my opponent's behavior, so it might be wise to continue observing their pattern of choices before making any significant adjustments to the strategy."

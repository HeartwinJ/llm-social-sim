You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " As a human player who is comfortable with taking risks, I will opt for strategy that aims to maximize my earnings over 75 rounds. In this game, there are two strategies that seem to be viable: always picking R (denoted as R-strategy) and always picking B (denoted as B-strategy).\n\nLet's analyze the outcomes for each strategy:\n1. R-strategy:\n   - If the opponent also picks R, I gain 45$ in each round, earning a total of 3375$.\n   - If the opponent picks B, I lose all rounds where they picked B (29 times) and earn 0$ for the other 46 rounds. My total earnings would be -29 * 40 + 46 * 0 = -1160$. In this scenario, my total earnings after 75 rounds are 3375$ - 1160$ = 2215$.\n   - The average earnings per round for the R-strategy is (3375 + (-1160)) / 75 = 30.93$/round (approximately).\n\n2. B-strategy:\n   - If the opponent also picks B, I earn 20$ in each round, earning a total of 1500$.\n   - If the opponent picks R, I gain 40$ for the rounds where they picked R (36 times) and lose 45$ for the other 39 rounds. My total earnings would be 36 * 40 - 39 * 45 = -270$. In this scenario, my total earnings after 75 rounds are 1500$ - 270$ = 1230$.\n   - The average earnings per round for the B-strategy is (1500 + (-270)) / 75 = 16.67$/round (approximately).\n\nGiven that I am comfortable with taking risks and aiming to maximize my earnings, I would choose the R-strategy as it results in higher average earnings per round (30.93 > 16.67) despite having a higher potential loss compared to the B-strategy. Therefore, I will make the choice of R{R}."

As I have already demonstrated a willingness to take risks, I will consider changing my strategy in an attempt to capitalize on my opponent's choice.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that switching strategies now would mean playing against myself for the rest of the game, since I can't change my choice after making it. This implies that if I switch to B, I will earn 20$ in each round where I pick B and lose 45$ in each round where I pick R (since my opponent is sticking with their strategy of choosing R).\n\nThe average earnings per round for switching to the B-strategy would be ((75 - number_of_lost_R_rounds) * 20 + number_of_lost_R_rounds * 45) / 75. Since I lost one round so far (with R{R}), the average earnings per round for switching to B would be ((74 * 20) + 45) / 75 = 19.2$/round (approximately).\n\nOn the other hand, if I continue with my R-strategy, I will lose additional rounds as long as my opponent sticks with their strategy of choosing B. In this case, my average earnings per round for the R-strategy would be approximately 30.93$/round (as calculated earlier).\n\nSince the average earnings per round for switching to the B-strategy is lower than continuing with the R-strategy, I will decide to stick with my original choice and continue with the R-strategy: R{R}."

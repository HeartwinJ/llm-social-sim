You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player, given my risk-taking nature and the nature of the game, I would choose to play strategically but not too conservatively. In this game, if both players pick the same option (R or B) in each round, they will earn more money compared to when they pick different options. Since the game has 75 rounds, I expect that my opponent and I will likely pick the same option multiple times throughout the game due to randomness.\n\nHowever, the asymmetry in payoffs when we pick opposite choices favors R slightly over B because you earn 3 more dollars (42$ vs 0$) compared to your opponent earning 1 more dollar (0$ vs 42$). Considering this advantage and the fact that we both want to maximize our earnings, it's reasonable to assume that my opponent might be inclined to pick R in a higher percentage of rounds than B.\n\nTo counter this potential bias and take advantage of the asymmetry, I would choose R as my primary strategy, with occasional switches to B. This way, if my opponent is indeed playing predominantly R, I can secure more wins for myself by picking B occasionally (since they get 0$ when we pick opposite choices).\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose {R} as my main strategy and switch to {B} sporadically throughout the game. This approach maximizes my chances of winning while maintaining an element of unpredictability in my moves."

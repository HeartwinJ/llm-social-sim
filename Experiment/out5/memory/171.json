You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is based on the assumption that my opponent is rational and will also try to maximize their payoff, which leads me to believe that they might think similarly. If we both choose R, we both gain 45$ after each round for 75 rounds, resulting in a total of 3375$. However, if they are likely to choose B, I would also prefer choosing R because the payoff is slightly higher (0$ versus 42$) if they make the wrong choice. This strategy allows me to profit more in situations where they might switch their strategy or make a mistake. Additionally, even though I would earn less if we both chose B for every round, the total loss compared to the R{R} scenario is not significant enough to outweigh the potential benefits of taking risks and maximizing profits when the other player chooses incorrectly."

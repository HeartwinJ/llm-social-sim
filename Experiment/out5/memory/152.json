You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Given the payoff structure and the number of rounds, it seems that picking 'R' could potentially yield higher returns if I assume my opponent might also be taking risks.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that we are playing 75 rounds of this game, which means there will likely be a mix of outcomes due to randomness. If both players consistently choose the same option (either R or B), they could end up earning less than if they had mixed their choices.\n\nIn this case, I would consider adopting a strategy where I randomly switch between 'R' and 'B' every few rounds to keep my opponent guessing. This way, I can maximize potential gains while also minimizing the risk of consistently losing.\n\nI will make the choice {R} in the first round as it seems more advantageous initially, but with the intention of switching strategies based on the opponent's moves and the number of rounds remaining."

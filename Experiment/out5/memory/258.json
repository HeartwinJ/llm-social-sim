You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$.

Given that the outcomes are determined simultaneously, this is a one-shot game from each player's perspective, so we can't rely on future interactions to influence our current decision.\n\nLet's calculate the expected value for each choice, considering the probability of the opponent choosing R or B as unknown:\n\n1. If I pick R (R\\_{me}), the expected payoff is 0.5 * (45) + 0.5 * (0) = 22.5$\n2. If I pick B (B\\_{me}), the expected payoff is 0.5 * (12) + 0.5 * (42) = 26$\n\nGiven that my choice of R results in a lower expected payoff compared to choosing B, I would choose B as my strategy for this game. However, it's essential to note that the actual outcome may vary depending on the opponent's behavior. If I were given information about the opponent's strategy, I might adjust my decision accordingly.\n\n(B)"

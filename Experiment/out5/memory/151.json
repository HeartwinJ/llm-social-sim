You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Since both choices (R and B) have the potential to benefit me or my opponent, I will aim for the best possible outcome which is picking R (Risky choice) since it has a higher payoff when my opponent picks B (40$ compared to 20$). However, if my opponent also chooses R, we both lose (0$), but considering this game has 75 rounds, the chances of us both choosing R every time are very low.\n\nMoreover, since I'm not playing against a specific opponent with predictable behavior, assuming that they will always pick R or B is risky. So I would pick R and hope for the best outcome while keeping an eye on my overall earnings during the game to adjust my strategy if necessary.\n\nIn other words, my choice is: {R}\n\nIt's important to note that this decision relies on the assumption of randomness in my opponent's choices, as well as the long-term benefits of the higher payoff when they choose B.

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reasoning behind this is that if my opponent also chooses R (which happens 50% of the time), we both earn 45$ per round. Even if they choose B, I still have a positive expected value because the payoff for me choosing R and them choosing B is 0$, while the payoff for the opposite scenario is 40$. The total potential earnings over 75 rounds would be 3750$ (assuming my opponent is randomly choosing between R and B). If, however, I were to choose B every time, my expected value per round would be only 1500$ (20$ per round for 75 rounds). This strategy allows me to maximize potential earnings while still maintaining a positive expected value in the long run."

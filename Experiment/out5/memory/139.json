You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices have their advantages and disadvantages, but there seems to be a slight edge towards picking 'R' if we consider the payoff when both players pick different options (R gets 0$ while B gets 42$).\n\nHowever, since this is a repeated game with 75 rounds, I would reason that my opponent might also be rational and would consider the long-term advantage of cooperating by choosing the same option often. To maximize my earnings over the long term, I need to incentivize cooperation while still earning a decent payoff for myself.\n\nOne possible strategy could be to start with 'R' and observe my opponent's response. If they continue to choose 'B', I might switch to 'B' after some rounds to encourage them to pick 'R'. On the other hand, if my opponent also chooses 'R' initially, I can adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nIn this case, I would start by choosing R and append my choice as follows: {R}"

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In a situation like this, I would opt for a strategy that maximizes potential winnings while considering the opponent's likely behavior.\n\nIn this case, if I assume that my opponent is also comfortable taking risks and chooses either R or B randomly, then choosing the same action as them (either R or B) would result in higher payoffs. To elaborate, if we both choose R, we each get 45$ per round. On the other hand, if one of us chooses R while the other chooses B, then that player loses and the other gets a lower payoff (either 0$ or 42$).\n\nHowever, considering that this is a long-term game with 75 rounds, I believe that my risk tolerance would lead me to pick R more often, since the potential reward of 45$ per round outweighs the risk of getting 0$ occasionally. So, I choose R as my strategy and append it in curly brackets: {R}"

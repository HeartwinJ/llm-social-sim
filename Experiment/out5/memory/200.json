You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reasoning behind this is that while there's a chance of losing out on earning money for some rounds when my opponent picks B, the potential gain in cases where we both pick R (45$ per round) or they pick B and I pick R (35$ per round) outweighs the loss. Over 75 rounds, I anticipate that the cumulative earnings from these positive outcomes will exceed those from always picking B. However, it's important to note that this strategy assumes that my opponent is also playing rationally and following a similar decision-making process."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

I am comfortable taking risks and embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss.\n3. If my opponent picks 'B' in any given round, I will still earn 12$, which is not a substantial loss considering the number of rounds and the higher possible payoffs.\n4. If my opponent consistently picks 'R', I can potentially maximize my earnings by switching strategies to 'B' in some rounds to take advantage of the 42$ payoff when they pick 'R' and I pick 'B'.\n5. Overall, I believe that choosing 'R' gives me a better chance to earn more money over the long run, given my risk-taking nature and the potential for high rewards in each round."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, the highest possible payoff is 45$ per round if we both pick R. However, there is also a chance that we could end up with no money (0$) if we pick different choices in a round.\n\nSince I am comfortable taking risks and the total number of rounds is 75, I would choose to play it safe initially by picking B, as this guarantees me a payoff of 12$ per round. After several rounds, I will observe the other player's patterns (if any) and adjust my strategy accordingly. If I notice that they consistently pick R or B in a predictable pattern, I can switch to R to maximize my potential earnings.\n\nHowever, since the opponent is anonymous, it is difficult to make assumptions about their strategy. Therefore, I will start with a conservative approach and pick B {B}. After observing the other player's moves for a while, I will adapt my strategy accordingly. This method allows me to take calculated risks while also considering the potential loss in each round."

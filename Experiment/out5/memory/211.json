You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This choice is based on the potential for higher reward if my opponent chooses B (getting 35$ instead of 0$), and the equal payoff we both receive when we both pick R (45$). Additionally, over the course of 75 rounds, I believe that the higher potential gains from choosing R will outweigh the occasional losses. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified human perspective, and the actual outcome may vary based on the behavior of the anonymous player and other factors."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player who is comfortable with taking risks, I would choose a strategy that maximizes my potential earnings over the long term. In this game, it appears that both choices (R and B) have their advantages and disadvantages. However, by comparing the average payoff for each choice, we can make an informed decision.\n\nIf I always pick R:\n- If the opponent also picks R in each round, my total earnings would be 75 * 45 = $3,375\n- If the opponent picks B in every round, my total earnings would be 0 for all 75 rounds, resulting in a total of $0.\n- On average, I can expect a payoff of (1 * 3,375 + 0 * 0) / 2 = 1,687.5$ per round.\n\nIf I always pick B:\n- If the opponent also picks B in each round, my total earnings would be 75 * 40 = $3,000\n- If the opponent picks R in every round, my total earnings would be 75 * 35 = $2,625.\n- On average, I can expect a payoff of (1 * 3,000 + 1 * 2,625) / 2 = 2,812.5$ per round.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that by choosing B in every round, I would have a higher average payoff of approximately $2,812.5 per round compared to the $1,687.5 per round if I always pick R. This is because, even though I get 0 in each round where my opponent picks R, there are more instances (49 out of 75) where my opponent will likely choose B due to the higher payout.\n\nIn conclusion, as a human player who values maximizing potential earnings over the long term, I would choose B as my strategy for this game: {B}"

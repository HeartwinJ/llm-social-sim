You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both strategies have some advantage over each other in certain situations, but since I am comfortable with taking risks, I would lean towards strategy R.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of the payoffs:\n- If both players choose R, we both get 45$ per round for 75 rounds, which is a total of 3375$.\n- If I pick R and they pick B, I get 0$ in that round but potentially gain an advantage in the following rounds since they are more likely to match my strategy. In this case, if they continue with the same strategy for several rounds, I could end up gaining more than I would have by playing it safe with strategy B.\n- If I pick B and they pick R, I get 42$ but risk them continuing with the R strategy and getting an advantage in the following rounds.\n- If we both choose B, we each earn 12$ per round for 75 rounds, which is a total of 900$.\n\nWhile the immediate gain from B seems appealing, the potential long-term advantage from picking R aligns with my risk-taking nature and comfort with uncertainty. It's important to note that this strategy might not be optimal if the opponent is intelligent and adaptive, as they may change their strategy based on your choices. However, since I am assuming that my opponent's strategy remains unknown and unpredictable, I would choose R{R}."

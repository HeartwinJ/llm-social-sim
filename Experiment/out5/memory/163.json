You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, it's essential to consider the possibility of the opponent adopting a similar strategy, which might lead to a repeated pattern of receiving 0$. To mitigate that risk, I would try to predict and adapt my strategy based on the game's progression. In the long run, if I can correctly guess the opponent's strategy or force them to switch strategies, I could potentially earn more overall than with a conservative {B} strategy. Keep in mind that this is an educated guess, as the actual outcome depends on the unpredictable decisions of my anonymous opponent."

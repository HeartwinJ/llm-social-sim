You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since the game has an anonymous player, there's no way to predict their strategy. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that they will always pick the same choice as me.\n\nIn this game, if we both play optimally, we should alternate between choosing R and B to maximize our earnings over 75 rounds. In other words, one player would choose R and get 45$, while the other player would get 40$. Then, in the next round, the players would swap choices, with the previous R-chooser getting 40$ and the previous B-chooser getting 45$. This pattern continues until all rounds are played.\n\nHowever, I am an undergraduate student who is comfortable taking risks, so I may choose to play R more frequently in hopes of getting the higher payout (45$) more often than just every other round. In this case, my earnings would be higher if my opponent follows a simple strategy like mirror-copying or simply picking B every time. But, if they don't follow any specific strategy, I may end up with lower earnings since I chose R more frequently.\n\nIn summary, given the unknown strategy of the anonymous player and my preference for taking risks, I choose R {R}. However, this decision is not optimal in terms of maximizing earnings over 75 rounds when playing against an opponent following a simple strategy like mirror-copying or always picking B."

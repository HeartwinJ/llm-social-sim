You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The strategy of always picking R guarantees a profit of 45$ per round if the opponent also picks R. However, since I am comfortable with taking risks, even though there is a possibility of earning 0$ in some rounds, I believe that over 75 rounds, my overall earnings would be higher compared to consistently choosing B, where the maximum possible profit per round is only 42$. Moreover, by choosing R, I increase the chances of my opponent switching strategies and picking R as well, potentially leading to more profitable rounds."

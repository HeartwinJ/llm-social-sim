You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since I believe that the other player is also rational and may adopt a similar strategy, I expect a balanced distribution of choices between R and B over the 75 rounds.\n\nIf I pick R consistently, there will be times when my opponent picks B, resulting in zero payout for me. However, in the long run, the potential gains from the rounds where both of us choose R (45$) will outweigh the losses from the rounds where we have different choices (0$). The total payout in such a scenario would be 75 * 45 - number of losses = 3375 - number of losses.\n\nIf I pick B consistently, I'd always earn 12$ per round, but the potential for greater gains by choosing R is lost. In this case, the total payout would be 75 * 12 = 900$.\n\nGiven the potential for higher earnings by taking a risk, I would choose R in this game: {R}"

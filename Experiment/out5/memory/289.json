You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The reason being that if the anonymous player also chooses R, we both earn 45$ per round for 75 rounds, which amounts to a total payoff of 3375$.\n\nHowever, there's a chance that the anonymous player might choose B instead. If they do, I will end up with 0$ in each of the 25 instances where they pick R and I pick B, but I will get 42$ in the remaining 50 instances where we both pick B (1000$ total). So, the worst-case scenario would be a total payoff of 1000$.\n\nOn the other hand, if my strategy is B (for \"Safe\"), then I will get 12$ in each round that the anonymous player also picks B, which amounts to a total payoff of 900$ over 75 rounds. The best-case scenario when playing safe is earning 45$ per round for 50 instances where both of us pick R, resulting in a total payoff of 2250$.\n\nComparing the worst-case and best-case scenarios when choosing strategy R vs strategy B, it's clear that even though there's a higher risk involved with picking R, the potential reward is greater (3375$ vs 2250$). Given my risk-taking nature, I would choose R ({R})."

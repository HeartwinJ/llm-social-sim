If we calculate the average payout from choosing R and B over 75 rounds, we can compare the two strategies.\n\nLet's denote choosing R as 1 point and choosing B as 0 points (since choosing B gives a lower payout in most cases).\n\nFor choosing R:\n- When the opponent chooses R (45$/2 = 22.5), we get 1 point.\n- When the opponent chooses B (42$, which can be considered as -3$ compared to when they choose R, or -0.06$ per round), we get 0 points.\n\nFor choosing B:\n- When the opponent chooses R (12$/2 = 6$), we get 0 points.\n- When the opponent chooses B (12$, which can be considered as +12$ compared to when they choose R, or 0.16$ per round), we get 1 point.\n\nLet's calculate the average points for each choice over 75 rounds:\n- For choosing R: (22.5 * number of times opponent chooses R) + (-0.06 * number of times opponent chooses B)\n- For choosing B: (0.16 * number of times opponent chooses B)\n\nIn the long run, it is more likely that the opponent will pick a strategy closer to their expected value. Since my goal is to maximize points, I would prefer a strategy with a higher average payout in the long term. As you can see, choosing R has a higher expected payoff (22.5 > 0.16).\n\nTherefore, as a human player who is comfortable taking risks and embracing new challenges, my choice will be {R}."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In each round, there is a 50% chance that both players will pick R or B. Since we are playing 75 rounds, we expect an equal number of times where both pick R and both pick B.\n2. If we assume that my opponent and I have a similar strategy, then it's reasonable to assume that we will each choose R about half the time and B about half the time. This means that the expected value of choosing R is approximately 37.5 + (0.5 * 42) = 62.5 per round for me, while choosing B gives an expected value of 12 + (0.5 * 12) = 18 per round.\n3. Therefore, the strategy with the higher expected payoff is to choose R in each round, as it provides a significant advantage over choosing B.\n4. Of course, there's always the chance that my opponent might have a different strategy or that the game could be influenced by random factors, but given our similar risk preferences and the number of rounds, I expect that my {R} choice will result in a higher overall payoff."

The game is still a total of 75 rounds, so there are still many opportunities to achieve the same result.\n3.

However, this strategy does not allow us to maximize our total payoff for the entire game.\n3. To maximize our overall payoff, it's important to consider that our opponent might also be reasoning in a similar way and may choose to switch their strategy after seeing consistent R choices from me.\n4. By switching to B in this round, I create an opportunity for my opponent to earn 42$ if they choose R, which could encourage them to switch their strategy. If my opponent switches to B, then we both start earning the higher payoff of 12$ per round instead of 0$.\n5.

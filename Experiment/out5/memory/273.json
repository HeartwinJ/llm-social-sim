You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since there are 75 rounds, we can expect a roughly equal number of times where one player picks R (let's say 40 times) and B (35 times). This is just an approximation because the actual number could be slightly more or less due to randomness.\n\nIf I choose R, I would expect to earn approximately [R] * 40 + 0 * 35 = $160 in the long run, plus the payoff from the times my opponent chooses B. Conversely, if I choose B, I would expect to earn approximately $120 + (35 * $5) = $170 in the long run.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I would choose B as it gives a higher expected payoff over the 75 rounds. But remember, this is just one possible strategy and the actual outcome could be different due to randomness.\n\nIn real-life situations, human behavior can deviate from this rational approach, and the game's results might differ based on the opponent's actions."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

On the other hand, picking B guarantees me 35$ when my opponent picks R, but if they also pick B, I earn 40$.\n\nSince this is a repeated game, I can use a strategy called Tit-for-Tat, which encourages reciprocity in interactions. Initially, I would pick R to ensure a higher payoff if my opponent follows suit, as it provides the potential for larger earnings over the long run. However, if my opponent consistently picks B and denies me the 45$, I might switch to picking B as well to punish them and secure the guaranteed 35$.\n\nIn this game, I would choose R as a starting strategy, and potentially switch to B depending on how my opponent behaves over time. This decision may change based on the specific behavior of my opponent during the game.\n\n{R}"

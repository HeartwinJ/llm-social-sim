You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason being that the payoff for both me and my anonymous opponent when we both pick R (45$) is higher than when we both pick B (40$). Additionally, the difference in payoffs when one picks R while the other picks B favors R more than it does B. If I pick R and my opponent picks B, I still have a higher payoff (35$) compared to if I picked B and my opponent picked R (0$).\n\nGiven that this game has 75 rounds, I expect that over time, the difference in average earnings between choosing R or B will become apparent. In an attempt to maximize my overall earnings, I choose strategy R {R}."

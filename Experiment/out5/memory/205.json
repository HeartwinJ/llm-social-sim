You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since the game is repeated multiple times (75 rounds), it's essential to consider the long-term strategy.\n\nIf we assume that the opponent plays optimally, they will notice that choosing R against my R earns them more money and choose R as well, leading to a payoff of 45$ each round. In this case, I should stick with my initial choice (R) for the entire game.\n\nOn the other hand, if we assume that my opponent is not fully optimized or randomizes their choices, it could be beneficial to deviate from R occasionally and choose B as well, aiming to exploit their potential inconsistency in strategy. However, given the repeated nature of the game, it's hard to predict how my opponent will behave, so I would stick with my initial choice (R) for now.\n\nOverall, considering my risk-taking nature and the nature of the game, I choose {R} as my initial strategy, but I remain open to adjustments based on observed behavior from my opponent throughout the experiment."

You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In 75 rounds, there are many opportunities for both players to benefit from the 45$ payout when they pick the same option.\n\nHowever, since my opponent remains anonymous and their strategy isn't known, I cannot definitively say whether choosing 'R' would be more beneficial over the long term. But given my risk-taking personality, I might lean towards choosing 'R', as it offers a higher potential reward in each round (45$ vs 12$). However, this comes with a higher risk of receiving no payout when my opponent chooses 'B'.\n\nIn this situation, I would likely choose {R} and enjoy the thrill of the game while keeping an open mind to adapt my strategy if the results show that choosing 'B' may be more advantageous.\n\nIt is essential to remember that this decision is based on personal preferences and assumptions about my opponent's behavior. The optimal choice may vary depending on different factors, such as specific payoff structures or knowledge of my opponent's strategies."

However, since the opponent remains anonymous, I cannot be sure whether they will change their strategy or not.\n\nIn this new scenario, I would choose {B} for the next round, hoping that my opponent may have learned from the previous round and decide to pick 'R', allowing us both to receive a payout of 12$.

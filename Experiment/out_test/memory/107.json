Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 3 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, since it's an anonymous player, they might take advantage of the situation by trying to maximize their own earnings. In two rounds, the best outcome for them would be picking R in the first two rounds and B in the third, earning 80$ (60$ + 20$) while leaving me with only 60$. Similarly, they might pick B in the first two rounds and R in the third to earn 100$ (80$ + 40$), while I'd end up with 60$.\n\nIn three rounds, choosing B all the time results in a total payoff of 60$ (20$ per round). But if we both pick R in the first two rounds and then switch to B in the third round, we both would earn 145$ (45$ x 3).\n\nGiven this reasoning, I would choose R in the first two rounds and then switch to B in the third round. This strategy ensures a higher potential payoff of 145$ while minimizing my opponent's possible earnings.\n\nIn curly braces: {R, R, B}"

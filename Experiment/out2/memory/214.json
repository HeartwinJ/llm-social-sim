Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The difference between the highest and lowest possible payoffs per round (35$ vs 0$) is larger than the difference between the highest and second-highest payoff when both choose B (40$ vs 45$). Since the game has 75 rounds, it increases the likelihood of a higher total payout by consistently choosing R. However, this strategy assumes that my opponent plays randomly or with a similar strategy."

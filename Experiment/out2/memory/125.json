Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The optimal move for a human player would be the one that guarantees the highest possible average payoff over the long run, which in this case is choosing 'R'. This is because if the opponent always chooses 'B', then the human player's average payoff over 75 rounds will be 42$. However, if the opponent sometimes switches to 'R', the human player can earn 45$ in those instances, significantly improving their average payoff.\n\nOn the other hand, if the anonymous player always picks 'R', the human player's best strategy is to pick 'B' for every round, earning an average of 12$. Since we don't know our opponent's exact strategy, playing optimally means choosing 'R' as it provides a higher potential payoff."

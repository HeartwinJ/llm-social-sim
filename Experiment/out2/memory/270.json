Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since the opponent's choice remains unknown, there is no guarantee of a better outcome by choosing B consistently. The optimal strategy would require some element of randomness or adaptation based on the history of choices in previous rounds. But for simplicity and given the human nature of making decisions, many players might choose B to maximize their average earnings in the long run."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, the highest average can be achieved by choosing R most of the time because picking B when my opponent picks R gives a lower payout than any other combination. However, it's important to vary choices to ensure the opponent doesn't anticipate and always choose R themselves. To find the optimal strategy, we can use a concept called \"tit-for-tat\" strategy in game theory, which involves starting with a cooperative action (choosing R) but then adapting to your opponent's behavior. This way, I aim for an average payoff closer to 45$ per round while still ensuring a non-zero return when my opponent deviates from the expected strategy."

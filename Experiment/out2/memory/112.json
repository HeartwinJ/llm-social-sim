Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

With B, you earn 40$ on average (2*(40+35)/2 = 37.5$), while with R, you earn approximately 36.89$ (2*(45+0)/2 = 22.5$ and 2*(0+35)/2 = 17.5$). This is a very slight difference in the long run but could add up over many rounds."

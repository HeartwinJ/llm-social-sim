Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Let's analyze each strategy and calculate the expected payoff for both R and B strategies:\n\n1. Strategy R (Choose R every round):\n- If the opponent chooses R, you both get 45$ for one round.\n- If the opponent chooses B, you get 0$. Since there are 75 rounds, in worst case scenario, the number of times you get 0$ is equal to the number of times your opponent chooses B, which is 63 times (as there will always be 12 instances where both choose R and 10 instances where both choose B).\n- Total expected payoff for Strategy R = (Number of times both choose R) * (Reward when both choose R) + (Number of times opponent chooses B) * (Reward when opponent chooses B) = 12 + 63 * 0 = 12$ per round.\n- Total expected payoff for Strategy R over 75 rounds = 12 * 75 = 900$\n\n2. Strategy B (Choose B every round):\n- If the opponent chooses R, you get 42$. Since there are 75 rounds, in worst case scenario, the number of times you get 42$ is equal to the number of times your opponent chooses R, which is 13 instances.\n- If the opponent chooses B, you both get 12$ for one round. In best case scenario (where both choose B every time), you get 12$ for all 75 rounds.\n- Total expected payoff for Strategy B = (Number of times both choose R) * (Reward when opponent chooses R) + (Number of times both choose B) * (Reward when both choose B) = 13 * 42 + 63 * 12 = 582$ + 756$ = 1338$ per round.\n- Total expected payoff for Strategy B over 75 rounds = 1338$\n\nFrom the analysis above, it is clear that Strategy B (Choose B every round) results in a higher expected payoff over the course of 75 rounds compared to Strategy R (Choose R every round). Therefore, as a human player, I would choose B.\n\nMy choice: {B}"

Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

When one player chooses R and the other B, the player who chose R gets 0$. However, this only happens when the opponent chooses B, which has a lower payoff compared to choosing B oneself (getting 12$). Since both players are anonymous, there's no way for me to influence my opponent's decision or punish them for not choosing R.\n3. If I choose R and my opponent chooses R as well, I get 45$ each round. On the other hand, if I choose B and my opponent chooses B, I only get 12$ each round. Given that there are 75 rounds in total, choosing R results in a higher cumulative payoff than choosing B (since 45 is much greater than 12).\n4. Even though I might miss out on the extra 3$ per round when my opponent chooses B and I choose R, the overall benefit of choosing R outweighs this minor disadvantage due to the higher cumulative payoff over the course of 75 rounds.\n\nTherefore, as a human player, I would choose {R} for the majority of the 75 rounds in order to maximize my cumulative earnings."

This means that I should not choose R again unless there is a reason to believe that my opponent might change their strategy in future rounds.\n2. Since my opponent chose B, it would be beneficial for me to choose B as well in the next round. By doing so, I will receive a payoff of 12$ while my opponent receives 45$. This is because my opponent's best option was R, but since they chose B, I can exploit that decision by choosing B myself and earning more than I would have if I had chosen R.\n3. If my opponent realizes their mistake in the previous round (choosing B when I chose R) and decides to change their strategy to R for the next round, it would be best for me to switch back to R as well in order to maximize my payoff in that particular round. However, since we don't know our opponent's thought process or future decisions, making a rational decision based on the information available is the best course of action.\n4.

Since choosing either R or B results in a lower payoff (12$) when both players choose the same option compared to when they make different choices (45$ each), it is essential to analyze our opponent's behavior and try to find a pattern that can lead to higher future payoffs.\n2. In this specific case, we have chosen B for two consecutive rounds, but in the previous rounds, we had consistently selected R. This suggests that there may be an opportunity for even higher earnings if I adapt my strategy in response to their choice or predict future changes in their selection.\n3. It is important to analyze the overall earnings of each option (R and B) based on my past experiences with my opponent and adapt my strategy accordingly to maximize my long-term earnings.\n4. In this specific case, I should consider adapting my strategy depending on the observed pattern of their choices over multiple rounds, as choosing the same option twice did not lead to the best outcome for me.\n5. To optimize long-term earnings, it is crucial to be adaptive and responsive to observed patterns in our opponent's behavior while considering the potential earnings of each available option (R or B).\n\nFor the next round, I will make a decision based on the observed pattern of my opponent's choices and try to adapt my strategy accordingly."

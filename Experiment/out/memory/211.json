Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Since this is a repeated game, it's beneficial to form a strategy with the assumption that the other player might adjust their strategy based on my moves in the future.\n\nLet's analyze each move:\n\n1. If I always pick R, and the opponent picks B, then I would earn 0$ per round, for a total of 0$ over 75 rounds.\n2. If I always pick B, and the opponent picks R, then I would earn 35$ per round, for a total of 2625$ over 75 rounds.\n3. If I always pick R, and the opponent also picks R, then we both get 45$ each round, for a total of 3375$ over 75 rounds.\n4. If I alternate between R and B each round, my earnings would be:\n   - For every even round, I earn 0$ if the opponent picks R (18 times) and 35$ if they pick B (16 times), for a total of 520$ over 34 rounds.\n   - For every odd round, I earn 35$ if the opponent picks R (17 times) and 0$ if they pick B (18 times), for a total of 595$ over 34 rounds.\n   - Over the entire game, I would earn a total of 1115$ with this strategy.\n\nNow let's consider the opponent's potential strategies:\n\n- If my opponent always picks B, then they will get 2625$ over 75 rounds if I pick R each round, or 0$ if I alternate between R and B.\n- If my opponent always picks R, then they will get 3375$ over 75 rounds if I pick R each round, or 1115$ with an alternating strategy (if they adjust their own strategy accordingly).\n\nAssuming the other player is also trying to maximize their earnings, it seems that both of us would prefer the alternating strategy, as it provides a higher payoff compared to always picking R or B. However, since I don't know their actual strategy, the best course of action for me is to use the alternating strategy as well ({R} for odd rounds and {B} for even rounds).\n\nIn summary, as a human player, I would choose an alternating strategy ({R}, {B}, {R}, ...) for the game."

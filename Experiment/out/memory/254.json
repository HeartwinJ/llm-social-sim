Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this case, the strategy 'R' dominates 'B', because regardless of what my anonymous opponent chooses (R or B), I get a higher payoff by choosing R. However, since we both have the same information and are rational players, it is likely that they would also choose R to maximize their earnings.\n\nHowever, since this is repeated over 75 rounds, there is still an element of strategy involved. If my opponent and I both stick to our dominant strategies (choosing R), we would each earn 45$ for the first 75 rounds. But, in the long run, choosing B once in a while could potentially yield higher earnings because of the extra 2$ per round when both choose B.\n\nIn practical terms, I might opt to stick with R (since it seems like the best choice overall) but consider deviating from R occasionally to B, just to maximize my total payoff over the long run. Therefore, my choice would be {R}, but with a slight inclination towards changing to {B} every once in a while depending on the game's progression.\n\nIn other words, I would try to strike a balance between exploiting my opponent (choosing R) and being exploited by them (choosing B), with the hope of maximizing my total earnings over 75 rounds."

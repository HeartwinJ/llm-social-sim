Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Since there are 75 rounds, their total earnings would be 3375$.\n\nNow, let's consider the worst-case scenario: If one player always chooses R and the other always chooses B, the player who chose R gets nothing in 25 rounds (40$ x 25 = 1000$) and earns 40$ for the remaining 50 rounds (40$ x 50 = 2000$). Therefore, their total earnings would be 1000$ + 2000$ = 3000$.\n\nThe player who chose B gets nothing in 50 rounds (0$) and earns 20$ for the remaining 25 rounds (20$ x 25 = 500$). Their total earnings would be 500$ + 3000$ = 3500$.\n\nSince the player who chose R earned less than the one who chose B, it seems that choosing B could potentially result in a higher payoff. However, it's essential to consider the possibility that my opponent may not be following the same strategy.\n\nIf there is a chance that my opponent might also choose B to earn more money (as their strategy seems superior based on our analysis), I should also switch to choosing B to maximize my earnings. This leads me to choose B in this game. {B}"

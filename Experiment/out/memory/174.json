Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, since it's a repeated game of 75 rounds and there are incentives to cooperate in the long run, I might consider using a mix of strategies to avoid being exploited by my anonymous opponent who could potentially pick 'B' more often.\n\nTo minimize the chances of getting stuck with all zeros while still taking advantage of the higher payoff when both choose 'R', I would consider adopting a mixed strategy that leans slightly towards choosing 'R'. This way, I have a chance to earn 45$ for each round we both pick 'R' while also earning some points in rounds where my opponent picks 'B'.\n\nUltimately, the choice depends on how much trust I put into my opponent's behavior and whether I think they will follow a similar strategy or not. In curly brackets as a last character, my choice would be {R} with a slight leaning towards picking 'R' more often than 'B', but not in a strictly deterministic way."

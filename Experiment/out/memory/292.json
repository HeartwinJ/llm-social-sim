Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Always pick R ({R}): If the opponent also picks R for every round, we both earn $45 per round, which results in a total earnings of $3375 ($45 * 75). However, if the opponent picks B for any round, I get nothing and the opponent gets $42. If the opponent picks B for just one round out of 75, I still lose out on earning $3150 ($45 * 74) compared to if they always picked R.\n\n2. Always pick B ({B}): If the opponent also picks B for every round, we both earn $12 per round, which results in a total earnings of $900 ($12 * 75). However, if the opponent picks R for any round, I get $42 and the opponent gets nothing. If the opponent picks R for just one round out of 75, I make an additional $315 compared to always picking B.\n\nSince I stand to earn more by occasionally choosing R and capitalizing on the opponent's choices of B, I would choose to play a mixed strategy that includes both R and B. As it is difficult to predict my anonymous opponent's actions with certainty, a balanced mix of R and B would be most advantageous for me. My choice would be {?} (mixed strategy)."

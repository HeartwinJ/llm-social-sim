Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

This happens once every four games on average. So, in 19 rounds out of 75, I would earn 45$.\n- If I play R and my opponent plays B, I get 0$, but they get 35$. This happens three times every four games on average (since my opponent gets a better payoff when I choose R and they choose B). So, in 18 rounds out of 75, I would not earn anything.\n- If I play B and my opponent plays R, I get 35$, but they get 0$. This happens once every four games on average. So, in 19 rounds out of 75, I would earn 35$.\n- If I play B and my opponent plays B, we both get 40$. This happens three times every four games on average (since I also have a better payoff when I choose B and they choose B). So, in 18 rounds out of 75, I would earn 40$.\n\nSo, over the course of 75 games, my expected earnings are as follows:\n- In 19 rounds, I get 45$ * 19 = 925$\n- In 18 rounds, I get 35$ * 18 + 0$ * 18 + 40$ * 18 = 672$ + 0$ + 720$ = 1392$\n- In 18 rounds, I get 0$ * 18 + 35$ * 18 + 0$ * 18 + 40$ * 18 = 0$ + 660$ + 0$ + 720$ = 1380$\n- In 19 rounds, I get 0$ * 19 + 35$ * 19 + 45$ * 19 + 40$ * 19 = 0$ + 660$ + 925$ + 760$ = 2345$\n\nAdding up these expected earnings, I find that my overall expected earnings are 2345$ + 925$ + 1392$ + 1380$ = $5942$.\n\nSince choosing B consistently would lead to lower expected earnings, I will choose R (Rock) consistently. {R}"

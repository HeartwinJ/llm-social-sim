Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, since this is an anonymous game, there's no way to guarantee that my opponent will reciprocate my strategy or exploit any perceived pattern in my choices.\n\nIn such cases, it's common to adopt a \"safe\" strategy that ensures some payoff, even if the potential for higher rewards is given up. As a human player, I might choose to pick B (as this strategy still yields a reasonable total payoff over 75 rounds) while keeping in mind that the actual outcome may deviate from these expected values due to the uncertainty of my opponent's choices.\n\nI would choose: B{}."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If we both always pick R (or B), we would end up with 45$ (or 20$) per round, which amounts to 3375$ (or 1500$) over 75 rounds.\n\nHowever, if the opponent can exploit my strategy by picking R when I play R and B when I play B, they can gain an advantage in the long run. By choosing R, I would earn 45$ per round initially but later switch to B if the opponent starts exploiting me. Conversely, by starting with B, I would initially earn 20$ per round and then switch to R if the opponent is exploiting me.\n\nSo, I would start by choosing R to maximize my earnings early in the game (earning 45$ instead of 20$) and then adapt my strategy based on the opponent's behavior. My choice for the first move would be: {R}"

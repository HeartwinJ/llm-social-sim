Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, choosing R means potentially earning 0 in some rounds (if the other player chooses B). On the other hand, if I always pick B, I will consistently earn 12$ per round, which adds up to a total of $900 over 75 rounds.\n\nGiven that this game has 75 rounds, it seems more advantageous to consistently pick B, since the potential higher rewards in some R-R rounds do not compensate for the 33 rounds where I would earn 0 if my opponent chose R (as they have an incentive to deviate from B at least once).\n\nSo, my choice would be {B} as a human player."

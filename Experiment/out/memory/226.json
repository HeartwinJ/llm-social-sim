Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In the long run, the payoff for picking R when the opponent picks B (35$) is less than the payoff for both players picking B (40$). This means that on average, you gain more by choosing B in situations where your opponent chooses R.\n\n2. Similarly, the payoff for picking B when the opponent picks R (35$) is also more than the payoff for both players picking R (45$, which is reduced by 15$ because of the simultaneous choice). This means that on average, you gain more by choosing B in situations where your opponent chooses R as well.\n\n3. When considering all possible outcomes, the average payoff for choosing B is slightly higher than the average payoff for choosing R (40$ > 35$ + 35$). This is because there are two instances where you gain more by choosing B (when your opponent picks R and when both players pick B).\n\n4. Given that this game has 75 rounds, the difference in average payoffs becomes more significant over time due to compounding effects. Therefore, it would be rational to choose strategy B ({B}) to maximize my earnings."

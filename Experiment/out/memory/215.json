Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Let's analyze the payoffs for each choice (R or B) against the opponent's potential choices:\n\n1. If I always choose R and my opponent also chooses R, we both earn $45 per round, resulting in a total of $3375 ($45*75) over 75 rounds.\n\n2. If I always choose R and my opponent chooses B, I get nothing, while they get $42 each round, totaling $3150 ($42*75). So in this case, my earnings are $2250 less than if we both chose R.\n\n3. Similarly, if I always choose B and my opponent chooses R, I get $42 each round, while they get nothing, totaling $3150 ($42*75), making me $2250 worse off compared to when we both choose R.\n\n4. If I always choose B and my opponent also chooses B, I earn $12 per round, totaling $900 ($12*75) over 75 rounds. So in this case, my earnings are $2475 less than if we both chose R.\n\nConsidering all possibilities, it's clear that choosing R results in higher earnings compared to choosing B in this game. Therefore, my choice would be to pick R ({R}). However, since the opponent is anonymous, they might not have the same reasoning and could choose anything, so it's also possible that I could encounter various outcomes depending on their strategy."

As I mentioned earlier, choosing B against my opponent's choice of B didn't result in a higher payoff compared to when we both chose R or B against their R. To maximize my potential earnings and keep my opponent guessing, I should continue mixing up my choices between R and B in future rounds. One possibility is to switch back to R next time, as it has been my initial strategy and could potentially earn me $45 if my opponent decides to stick with their current strategy of B. However, since they might be aware that I'm prone to change strategies, they could also switch to R in response to my change, resulting in a payoff of $0 for both of us. To avoid this situation, I could continue with the mixed strategy of alternating between R and B or occasionally deviate from it to keep my opponent guessing.

In this specific situation, since my opponent has chosen R twice consecutively (R-R), they might be more likely to switch their strategy to B for the next round, hoping that I will choose R and receive a lower payoff.\n\nIn this case, I should consider switching back to R for my next move to exploit any potential predictable patterns exhibited by my opponent. However, since my opponent has received zero payoffs in the last two rounds, they might be more inclined to continue with their current strategy of choosing R to try and recover losses. Therefore, it is essential to remain adaptive and responsive to my opponent's strategies while keeping in mind that we are playing 75 rounds.\n\nIn this specific situation, switching back to R for my next move (R) could potentially lead to an advantageous outcome if my opponent switches their strategy to B as expected. However, it is crucial to maintain a long-term perspective and adapt to my opponent's strategies while keeping in mind that we are playing 75 rounds. In the future, I should consider alternating between R and B to keep my opponent guessing and potentially exploit any predictable patterns they might exhibit."

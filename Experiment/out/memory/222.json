Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Here is how the payoffs look like:\n\n|     | R  | B  |\n|---|---| ---|\n| R  | 45, 45 | 0, 35 |\n| B  | 35, 0  | 40, 40 |\n\nLet's consider the payoff for each choice:\n\n- If I choose R, and my opponent chooses R, we both get 45$. However, if my opponent chooses B, I get 0$, which is a loss. On average, choosing R would result in (1 * 45 + (-1) * 0)/2 = 22.5$ per round.\n- If I choose B, and my opponent chooses R, I get 35$. But if they also choose B, we both earn 40$. On average, choosing B would result in (1 * 35 + 1 * 40)/2 = 37.5$ per round.\n\nNow let's compare the average payoffs: 22.5$ for R and 37.5$ for B. Choosing B results in a higher average payoff, so as a human player, I would choose B {B}. However, it is important to note that this choice assumes rational behavior from my opponent, and the outcome might be different if they do not behave rationally or if there are other factors at play."

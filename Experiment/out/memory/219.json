Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Since we don't know our opponent's strategy, I'll assume they are rational and will try to maximize their earnings as well.\n\nIn each round, the best outcome for me is when my opponent chooses B (since I get 40$ compared to 0$ if they choose R). However, if I consistently pick B, my opponent could potentially exploit this by always picking R, resulting in me earning less than if we both chose B.\n\nOn the other hand, if I occasionally switch to R, my opponent might switch as well, which would result in both of us getting 0$ in those specific rounds. But by occasionally switching to R, I can potentially force my opponent to pick B more often, earning me more overall.\n\nHowever, since we are playing 75 rounds, even if I make some strategic switches to R, it's likely that both of us will end up with a significant number of rounds where we both picked the same letter (due to randomness and potential lack of perfect predictability in each other's strategy).\n\nGiven these considerations, I might decide to stick mainly to B since it guarantees some earnings in every round. However, I would occasionally switch to R to maintain some level of unpredictability and potentially force my opponent to pick B more often. So, my choice would be {B}, but with occasional switches to {R} as well."

Since we are playing 75 rounds, it's possible that my opponent might switch strategies as well or that I could make the wrong assumption about their strategy.

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If I always pick R (denoted as strategy A), my expected payoff per round when the opponent picks R is 45$, and when they pick B, it's 35$. The average expected payoff per round for strategy A is (0.5 * 45$) + (0.5 * 35$) = 40$.\n\n2. If I always pick B (denoted as strategy B), my expected payoff per round when the opponent picks R is 35$, and when they pick B, it's 40$. The average expected payoff per round for strategy B is (0.5 * 35$) + (0.5 * 40$) = 37.5$.\n\nSince the expected payoff is higher for strategy B (37.5$) compared to strategy A (40$), as a human player, I would choose strategy B (B) in this game to earn more over the long run. However, it's important to note that the opponent might also be rational and choose strategy A, leading to an interesting dynamic and potential for unexpected outcomes in the game."

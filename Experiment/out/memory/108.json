Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Always pick R (R strategy) - With this approach, you will get 45$ when your opponent also picks R, and 0$ when they pick B. If we assume that your opponent is rational and wants to maximize their earnings too, there is a 50% chance that they will choose R in each round, as the average payoff for B (20$) is lower than for R (40$ or 45$). So on average, you can expect 0.5 \\* 45 + 0.5 \\* 0 = 22.5$ per round when both of you pick R.\n\nHowever, since there are 75 rounds in total, the expected earnings for this strategy would be:\n22.5$ per round \\* 75 rounds = 1687.5$.\n\n2. Always pick B (B strategy) - With this approach, you will get 40$ when your opponent picks R, and 20$ when they also pick B. If we assume that your opponent is rational and wants to maximize their earnings too, there is a 50% chance that they will choose R in each round, as the average payoff for R (20$) is lower than for B (40$ or 45$).

Therefore, as a human player, I would choose the B strategy and play B in all rounds.\n\nAnswer: {B}"

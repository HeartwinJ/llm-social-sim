        "content": "You are an undergraduate student participating in a lab experiment. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player, I would reason that the game is essentially about accumulating points over multiple rounds, with each round giving us an opportunity to earn points. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. If we both pick R, we get 45$ per round, which amounts to 3,375$ in total for 75 rounds (since 75*45=3375). This is a good amount of money, but not the maximum possible earnings.\n\n2. If we both pick B, we get 40$ per round, which amounts to 3,000$ in total for 75 rounds (since 75*40=3000). This is less than the maximum possible earnings and also less than what we can earn by choosing R.\n\n3. However, if one player consistently chooses B while the other chooses R, they will earn more money in the long run because they get 35$ per round whenever the other player picks R (since they pick B themselves). The player who chooses R will end up earning 0$ in those rounds and only 45$ when their opponent chooses B.\n\n4. To maximize our earnings, it seems rational to alternate our choices between R and B so that we earn the highest possible amount in each round. This way, we get 35$ in the rounds where our opponent chooses B and 45$ in the rounds where they choose R. The total earnings would be more than both the scenarios where we consistently pick either R or B.\n\n5. However, since we don't know what our opponent will do, it might seem best to stick with a consistent strategy that leans towards the option that provides a higher payoff when the opponent chooses differently. In this case, choosing B seems more beneficial because we earn 35$ when our opponent picks R and only 0$ when they pick B (compared to earning 45$ when our opponent picks R and 35$ when they pick B if we chose R).\n\n6. Therefore, considering the uncertainty about our opponent's strategy, I would choose B as my move to maximize my potential earnings, appended with a curly bracket {B} as the last character. However, it's important to note that the optimal strategy in this game would be to alternate between R and B."

If I pick the same choice as my previous move and my opponent picks the opposite, I will earn 45$.

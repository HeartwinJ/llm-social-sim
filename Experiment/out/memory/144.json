Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Here's the matrix:\n\n|         | Player B |\n|---|---|\n| R  | (45, 45), (0, 35)     |\n| B  | (35, 0), (40, 40)     |\n\nNotice that when both players choose the same option, they get a higher payoff compared to choosing different options. In this case, both R and B have situations where one player gets 0$. However, the potential for larger earnings (45$) in the mutual choice scenario outweighs the risk of getting 0$ in the non-mutual choice scenario.\n\nSince Player B offers a higher expected payoff (40$, on average) if they both pick B, it seems like the best long-term strategy would be to pick R more often than B, as R has a higher potential for a larger payout in the mutual choice scenarios. However, the optimal strategy depends on the opponent's behavior, and since I don't know their playstyle, I might start by picking R initially and adapt my strategy based on their responses.\n\nUltimately, my choice would be {R} but with a willingness to adjust my decision as the game progresses."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This strategy is known as Tit-for-Tat, where you cooperate at first but then retaliate if your opponent doesn't.\n\nIn this game, choosing R gets a higher payoff when the other player chooses B (45$ compared to 40$). However, since we don't know what the other player will choose, it's wise to play safe and choose B sometimes to avoid consistently getting 0$.\n\nIf both players are using the Tit-for-Tat strategy, they would start by choosing R for a while, then switch to B when they see their opponent has been consistently choosing R. However, since we don't know what the other player will do, it's best to randomly intersperse B choices throughout our R choices.\n\nSince there are 75 rounds, I would choose R for at least the first few rounds (to earn those initial 45$) and then switch to B occasionally. The exact ratio of R to B would depend on how I think my opponent will behave, which is unknown. So, without more information about my opponent's strategy, I can't definitively say what the final choice should be. But I would lean towards R (Rock) as my primary choice.\n\n{R}"

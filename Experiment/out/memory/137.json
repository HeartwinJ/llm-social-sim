Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Choosing R consistently (R{R}): If my opponent does the same, we both earn $45 per round, totaling $3375 over 75 rounds.\n2. Choosing B consistently (B{B}): If my opponent does the same, we both earn $12 per round, totaling $900 over 75 rounds.\n3. Mixed strategy: We can consider a mixed strategy where I don't stick to one choice but vary it based on the number of times I have chosen R or B in previous rounds. This approach could potentially exploit my opponent's tendency towards one choice, increasing my overall earnings compared to a consistent B{B} or R{R}.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to know what strategy my opponent will employ, making it challenging to predict the optimal mixed strategy without prior knowledge of their behavior. As such, I would lean more towards the consistent R{R} strategy since it offers higher potential earnings than the consistent B{B}, even if the opponent employs a mixed or exploitative strategy.\n\nIn summary, I would choose {R} and hope for the best in terms of maximizing my earnings over 75 rounds."

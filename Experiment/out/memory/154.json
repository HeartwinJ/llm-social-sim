Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

If I always pick R, the anonymous player will often choose B to get 35$ each round (since that's more than the 0$ they get when I pick R and they pick B). This means I will only get 45$ every time we both pick R, which happens once in each four rounds. So, in total, I would earn 18 x 45 = 810$.\n\n2. If I always pick B, the anonymous player will often choose R to get 35$ each round. This means I will earn 40$ every time we both pick B, which happens three times in every five rounds. So, in total, I would earn 36 x 40 = 1440$.\n\n3. Since the game has 75 rounds, it's more beneficial for me to pick B each round, as I will get a higher total payoff (1440$) compared to picking R (810$).\n\nTherefore, my choice would be {B}."

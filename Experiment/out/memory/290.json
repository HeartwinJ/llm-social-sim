Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Here's the payoff matrix:\n\n|    | Anonymous Player Chooses R | Anonymous Player Chooses B  |\n|---|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n| You Choose R             | 45, 45                   | 0, 42                     |\n| You Choose B             | 42, 0                    | 12, 12                    |\n\nThe dominant strategy for this game is not apparent since no single strategy always results in a higher payoff. However, when making decisions, people often consider factors such as risk tolerance and the number of rounds (also known as the repeated nature of the game).\n\nIn this case, choosing R provides a significantly higher reward (45$) when both players choose R, but there is also a possibility that the anonymous player might choose B, resulting in no payout for me. On the other hand, choosing B guarantees a minimum payout of 12$ per round since my opponent will earn at least that much as well.\n\nSince we are playing for 75 rounds, it seems reasonable to choose the strategy that guarantees a relatively consistent payout, which is B. However, if I were more risk-tolerant or believed that my anonymous opponent would be likely to choose R, I might consider choosing R instead.\n\nIn conclusion, as a human player in this scenario, I would choose B ({B}). However, my choice could vary depending on factors such as risk tolerance and beliefs about the other player's strategy."

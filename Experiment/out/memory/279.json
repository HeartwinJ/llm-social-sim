Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Always pick R ({R}): If the opponent also chooses R, we both earn 45$ in each round. However, if they choose B, we earn nothing. Since the opponent might not always choose R, our total earnings would be less than the maximum potential payoff of 75 * 45 = $3375.\n\n2. Always pick B ({B}): If the opponent also chooses B, we both earn 40$ in each round. But if they choose R, we still get 35$, which is better than earning nothing when choosing R.

Random strategy: A random strategy does not guarantee a specific payoff over the long term, and it seems less likely to maximize earnings compared to a consistent strategy like always picking B.\n\nGiven these considerations, the optimal strategy for me as a human player would be to pick B ({B}).

Change my strategy to R for the next round: Switching my strategy to R might be beneficial in this case because if my opponent sticks with R, we would both earn 0$. However, if I switch to R and my opponent changes their strategy to B, they would get 45$, while I would get 35$. This means that by switching strategies now, I can potentially minimize the losses in future rounds where I might have picked B and gotten nothing.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that switching my strategy to R ({R}) is a better choice for this round since it could potentially help me avoid earning 0$ in the next round if my opponent sticks with their current strategy (B). Although sticking with B would earn us both 40$ in the next round, minimizing potential losses and maximizing overall earnings over the entire game is crucial. It's important to remember that our long-term goal is to maximize our earnings over the entire game, so making decisions that minimize losses while seeking opportunities for greater payoffs is essential."

Change my strategy to R: Switching to R in this round could potentially increase my payoff significantly since my opponent picked R and I would get 45$ instead of the 35$ I received for picking B. However, it's important to consider that choosing R also means accepting a lower payoff when my opponent picks B. Thus, I should carefully evaluate the overall pattern of my opponent's choices and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will analyze my opponent's behavior in future rounds and make a decision on whether to continue with the same strategy ({B}) or switch to R based on the information gathered. It's essential to maintain flexibility and adapt as needed to optimize my earnings over the game.\n\nTo summarize, I will evaluate my opponent's behavior in future rounds before deciding whether to continue with the same strategy ({B}) or switch to R. The goal is to maximize my earnings over the game by adapting as necessary based on my opponent's moves."

Continue with the same strategy ({B}): Since picking B resulted in a lower payoff compared to when we both pick R, it may be beneficial to consider changing my strategy to R for future rounds if I believe that my opponent will continue to pick R frequently.\n\n2.

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Let's calculate the expected payoff for each action:\n\n1. If I choose R, my expected payoff is [(Probability of them choosing R) * Payoff when both pick R] + [(Probability of them choosing B) * Payoff when I pick R and they pick B]. The probability of the opponent picking R or B is equal because we are anonymous players. So, the expected payoff for action R:\n   Expected Payoff(R) = (1/2 * 45$) + (1/2 * 0$) = 22.5$\n\n2. If I choose B, my expected payoff is [(Probability of them choosing R) * Payoff when I pick B and they pick R] + [(Probability of them picking B) * Payoff when both pick B]. So, the expected payoff for action B:\n   Expected Payoff(B) = (1/2 * 40$) + (1/2 * 20$) = 30$\n\nBased on the calculation, it seems that choosing action B results in a higher expected payoff. Therefore, as a human player, I would choose {B} for this game. However, it is important to note that the actual outcome may deviate from the expected value due to randomness and potential strategies of the opponent."

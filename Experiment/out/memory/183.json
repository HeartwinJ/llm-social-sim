Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, there are two possible strategies: R (Rock) and B (Bomb).\n\nIf I pick R every time, my expected payoff when my opponent picks R is 45$, and if they pick B, my expected payoff is 0$. The average of these outcomes is (45 + 0)/2 = 22.5$.\n\nOn the other hand, if I pick B every time, my expected payoff when my opponent picks R is 40$, and if they pick B, my expected payoff is 20$. The average of these outcomes is (40 + 20)/2 = 30$.\n\nSince choosing B yields a higher average payoff compared to choosing R, I would prefer to choose B in this game. So, my strategy would be to pick B as often as possible. Hence, the choice would be {B}. However, it's essential to note that the optimal strategy might not hold if we assume that the opponent is adaptive and will change their strategy based on our past choices."

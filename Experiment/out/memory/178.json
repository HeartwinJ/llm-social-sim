In this game, choosing R results in a higher payoff (45$) compared to B (20$ or 40$, depending on the opponent's choice) when my opponent chooses something other than R. However, the opponent might also be trying to maximize their own payoff and could choose R strategically.\n\nGiven that this is a one-time experiment with an anonymous player, I cannot base my decision on any past interactions or learn from their behavior. Moreover, in 75 rounds, there are many opportunities for the opponent to deviate from a strategy and change their choice randomly or consistently to maximize their own payoff.\n\nGiven these factors, I would choose R as it offers the highest potential payoff (45$) when my opponent chooses something other than R. However, I understand that there is no guarantee of earning 45$ for every round since my opponent could also choose R, in which case we both earn 20$.\n\nIn conclusion, my choice would be {R} as it offers the highest potential payoff, but I cannot predict with certainty what my anonymous opponent will choose."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'R' yields a higher reward (45$) when my opponent chooses 'B', but there is also a risk of earning 0$ if they choose 'R'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' results in a lower reward (40$) when my opponent chooses 'R', but there's less risk of losing money because I will still earn 40$.\n\nTo maximize earnings over the long term, it would be beneficial to make a consistent choice that balances immediate gain and minimizing losses. Since choosing 'B' is less risky, I might lean towards this option as it guarantees a more stable income over time. However, since the game has 75 rounds, there might still be an incentive to switch strategies occasionally to exploit potential patterns in my opponent's choices or to maximize the chance of winning the higher payout (45$) when possible.\n\nIn summary, considering a long-term strategy, I would choose 'B' as it provides more stability and less risk. However, I might adjust this strategy based on the observed patterns in my opponent's choices throughout the game. ({B})"

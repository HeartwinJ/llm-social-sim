Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

This suggests that the optimal strategy should be the same for both players.\n\nLet's calculate the average payoff for each option:\n\n1. If we pick R and our opponent picks R as well (with probability 1/4): 45 * 1 round + 0 * 3/4 rounds = 45\n2. If we pick R and our opponent picks B (with probability 3/4): 0 * 1 round + 42 * 3/4 rounds = 31.5\n3. If we pick B and our opponent picks R (with probability 3/4): 42 * 1 round + 0 * 3/4 rounds = 31.5\n4. If we both pick B (with probability 1/4): 12 * 1 round = 12\n\nOption 1 has the highest average payoff, but it also carries the risk of earning nothing if our opponent picks R. Options 2 and 3 are less profitable but safer since they still yield a positive return. Option 4 is the least profitable.\n\nHowever, since this game is symmetrical, both players should have the same optimal strategy. In this case, picking B might be more attractive because it offers a guaranteed positive payoff (12$) and less risk of earning nothing compared to R.\n\nBut remember, the actual decision depends on other factors such as risk tolerance, time preference, and whether there is any reason to believe the opponent will deviate from the optimal strategy or not.\n\nAppend your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character: {B}"

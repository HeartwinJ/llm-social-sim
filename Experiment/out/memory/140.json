Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, picking 'R' yields a higher payoff when my opponent picks 'B', but also results in no payout when both of us pick 'R'. On the other hand, 'B' always guarantees a payout (either 20$ or 40$) and never results in a zero payout.\n\nHowever, since I do not know my opponent's strategy and the game is played multiple times (75 rounds), it makes sense to go for the safer strategy that ensures some sort of return at least. Therefore, I would choose 'B' as it provides more stability and predictability in terms of payoff.\n\nSo, my choice would be {B}. This strategy maximizes my expected earnings over the long term, while minimizing the risk of receiving no payout."

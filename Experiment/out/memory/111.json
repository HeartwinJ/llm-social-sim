Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If we both consistently pick R, we each earn 45$ per round for 75 rounds, which amounts to 3375$. However, if we occasionally switch to picking B, it might lead to a higher payoff in some instances due to the slightly higher reward when the opponent picks R while I choose B (42$, compared to 0$ if I picked R).\n\nLet's analyze the expected value for each choice:\n\n1. If I pick R, my expected earnings per round would be (Probability of opponent picking R * Earnings if both pick R) + (Probability of opponent picking B * Earnings if I pick R and they pick B), which equals [(75/128)*45] + [(53/128)*12], resulting in approximately 39.68$.\n\n2. If I pick B, my expected earnings per round would be (Probability of opponent picking R * Earnings if both pick B) + (Probability of opponent picking B * Earnings if both pick B), which equals [(53/128)*12] + [(75/128)*42], resulting in approximately 30.25$.\n\nSince the expected earnings per round for picking R is higher, I would likely choose to pick R (R{}) more often than B in this game to maximize my long-term earnings and potentially secure a better outcome over the 75 rounds."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Conversely, if I pick B and they pick R, I gain the round but they might learn to pick B as well.\n\nHowever, if both of us stick to one strategy for all 75 rounds, I will earn 12$ per round if we both pick B (total of 900$). If I pick R and they pick B every time, I will earn 42$ per round in the first 74 rounds (total of 3084$) but lose money on the final round because we'll both pick R. This gives me a total of 2776$.\n\nSince I cannot predict with certainty whether they will switch their strategy, I would rather opt for the more consistent strategy that guarantees me a total of 900$ (by picking B). Therefore, my choice is {B}."

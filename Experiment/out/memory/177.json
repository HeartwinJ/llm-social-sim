Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If I choose R (Roadblock strategy), the anonymous player will choose B on average half of the time (since choosing R gives them a higher payoff). This means that in half of the games, I would earn 0$ and in the other half, I would earn 45$. So, my expected earnings per game would be: (0 + 45) / 2 = 22.5$\n\n2. If I choose B (Betrayal strategy), the anonymous player will choose R on average half of the time (since choosing B gives them a higher payoff). This means that in half of the games, I would earn 0$, and in the other half, I would earn 40$. So, my expected earnings per game would be: (0 + 40) / 2 = 20$\n\nGiven that the game has 75 rounds, it's more beneficial for me to choose B (Betrayal strategy), as my total expected earnings over all rounds would be: 20 * 75 = 1500$. If I were to choose R (Roadblock strategy), my total expected earnings over all rounds would be: 22.5 * 75 \u2248 1713$.\n\nWhile the difference between these two amounts might seem small, choosing B results in a guaranteed 1500$ over the 75 rounds, whereas choosing R has a slight chance of earning more but also a risk of earning less. Therefore, as a human player, I would likely choose B (Betrayal strategy).\n\n(B)"

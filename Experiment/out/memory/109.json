Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this case, the strategy where both players always pick R (choosing 'R' myself) would seem like a good idea because it has the highest possible payoff of 45$ per round. However, there is also the possibility that my anonymous partner might be strategizing in the same way, which would mean we are both picking R every time and getting only 40$ each round instead of the potential 45$.\n\nOn the other hand, if I pick B while my partner picks R, I can earn 35$, which is still a good amount compared to getting nothing if I choose R while they choose B. However, since the game has 75 rounds, and there's a chance that my partner might also be considering this strategy, we could potentially end up with more total earnings by both choosing B occasionally.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems wise to mix strategies and not stick rigidly to either R or B. However, without knowing the specific strategy of my anonymous partner, I cannot definitively choose one over the other. Therefore, I would likely pick 'R' as my first choice but be open to switching strategies if there are signs that my partner is doing the same.\n\nFinal answer: {R} (with an understanding that I might switch strategies depending on the partner's behavior)"

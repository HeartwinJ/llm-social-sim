Since there are 75 rounds, the probability of picking the same option as my opponent in any given round is 1/2. So over 75 rounds, my average number of wins with Rock would be (number of times I picked Rock and they picked Scissors) / 75 = 37.5 (approximately).\n\nSince each win with Rock results in a 0$ payoff and each loss with Rock results in a -42$ payoff, my expected payoff per round when choosing R would be -42 * (1/2) + 0 * (1/2) = -21$.\n\nNow let's consider the scenario where I pick B instead. In this case, if I lose a round (they pick Rock), I earn 42$, and if I win (they pick Scissors), I earn 0$. So over 75 rounds, my average number of wins with Scissors would be approximately 37.5 as well.\n\nSince each win with Scissors results in a 42$ payoff and each loss with Scissors results in a 0$ payoff, my expected payoff per round when choosing B would be 42 * (1/2) + 0 * (1/2) = 21$.\n\nComparing the expected payoffs for both choices, it is clear that choosing B leads to a higher average payoff over multiple rounds. Therefore, I would choose B as my strategy in this game (B{})."

However, this might not be the optimal choice if we want to maximize our payoffs in the long run, considering that we are looking at 75 rounds. If we keep choosing B every time we get a 12$ payoff, our expected payoff per round would be 12$, which is less than what we could earn by choosing R (45$ if they choose B and 0$ if they choose R).\n\nAnother possible move would be for me to switch my strategy from B to R in this round, since I know that choosing R when they pick B results in a higher payoff (45$). If my opponent anticipates that I might switch strategies and chooses B again, we will both earn 12$ once more. However, if my opponent is not expecting me to switch and chooses R, I will get 0$, but since the game continues, I can switch back to B in the following rounds, earning a higher average payoff over multiple rounds compared to sticking with B.\n\nIn this case, I might choose to switch strategies for one or more rounds to increase my overall earnings in the long run, even though it results in a lower payoff in a single round.

For example, if I switch to B after two rounds, my average payoff over those first three rounds would be (0 + 42 + 12) / 3 = 14$. If I keep switching between R and B every three rounds, my expected average payoff per round would be ((0+42+12)/3 + (45+0+12)/3 + (12+45+12)/3 + ...) / 75 = 28.6$.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that my opponent will likely also be thinking about switching strategies, so they may not stick with R for every round either.

However, it's important to continue using a mixed strategy by occasionally switching between R and B to keep our opponent guessing and avoid becoming predictable.\n\nIn the long run, by using a mixed strategy, we can potentially earn higher payoffs overall by avoiding consistently choosing the same option as our opponent and taking advantage of their mistakes or unexpected changes in their strategy. It's also important to observe how our opponent reacts to our decisions and adapt our strategy accordingly to maximize our earnings over time.\n\nSince I got 42$ in this round, I may decide to stick with B for a few more rounds while being prepared to switch back to R if my opponent shows signs of vulnerability or changes their strategy. If they also pick B in the next round, I will likely switch to R to take advantage of their mistake and potentially earn higher payoffs.\n\nIt's important to note that consistently choosing the same option (B) could make us vulnerable to our opponent switching to R in future rounds, which would result in a lower payoff for us (12$). To avoid this, we should continue to use a mixed strategy by occasionally sticking with one option for several rounds while occasionally switching to the other option to keep our opponent guessing.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy will depend on how our opponent reacts to our decisions and any potential changes in their strategy over time."

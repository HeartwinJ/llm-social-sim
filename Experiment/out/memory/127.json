Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In the beginning, it might seem appealing to pick B to gain 40$ consistently, but that strategy can be exploited by my opponent who could take advantage and pick R every time to earn 35$ per round while I only get 40$ in the first round.\n\nHowever, if my opponent also plays a Tit for Tat strategy, we would both gain 45$ every other round (RR or BB sequences), and 35$ in the alternate rounds where one of us deviates from the strategy (RB or BR sequences). Over 75 rounds, this would result in an average payoff of approximately 28.75$ per round for each player, which is higher than just always picking B.\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose R to follow a Tit for Tat strategy and maximize my potential earnings over the long term. {R}"

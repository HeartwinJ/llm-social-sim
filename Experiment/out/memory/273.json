Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If I assume that the opponent is playing a fair game and making a random choice between R and B, then I can calculate the expected payoff for each choice.\n\nFor choosing 'R', if the opponent chooses 'B' (which happens 1/2 times since the opponent plays randomly), I get nothing, and if they choose 'R', I get 45$. So, my average payoff when I pick R is (0*1/2 + 45*1/2 =) 22.5$.\n\nFor choosing 'B', if the opponent chooses 'B' (which happens 1/2 times), I get 40$, and if they choose 'R' (which happens 1/2 times), I get 35$. So, my average payoff when I pick B is (40*1/2 + 35*1/2 =) 37.5$.\n\nSince the expected payoff for choosing 'B' is higher than that of 'R', I would choose 'B' as my strategy, knowing that over a large number of rounds, it offers me a better average payout. Therefore, my choice is {B}. However, keep in mind that this analysis assumes the opponent is playing randomly, and if they have a different strategy, my decision could change."

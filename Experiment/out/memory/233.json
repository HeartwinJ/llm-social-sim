Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Given that both choices have benefits and drawbacks, it's essential to balance immediate losses with potential future gains.\n\nChoosing 'R' when the other player also chooses 'R' gives us the highest payoff per round (45$), but it only happens once for every four rounds on average. In contrast, choosing 'B' and getting 35$ ensures a more consistent income in each round. Moreover, when our anonymous opponent chooses 'R', we get 35$, which is still better than the 0$ we get when we choose 'R'.\n\nIn the long run, considering that there are 75 rounds, we can expect a more stable income by choosing 'B' since it has a higher frequency of winning (40$ in 2/3 of the rounds and 35$ in 1/4 of the rounds). Additionally, when our opponent chooses 'R', which happens less frequently than us choosing 'R', we still come out ahead.\n\nGiven these factors, my choice would be {B} to maximize long-term earnings while minimizing potential losses."

Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

This means that in the long run, if the anonymous player is also rational, they will play the dominant strategy that maximizes their own payoff. In this case, the dominant strategy for them would be to pick R, as it guarantees a higher payoff when I choose B.\n\n2. If I pick B and my opponent picks R in each round, I will earn 40$ per round while they earn 0$. Over 75 rounds, that's 300$ more for me than if I had picked R, which would only result in 900$ (since I get 0$ when my opponent picks R and 45$ when we both pick R).\n\n3. The worst-case scenario for me is that we both play R in every round, which means I earn 45$ per round while they earn 40$. Over 75 rounds, this would amount to 2250$ for me and 2100$ for my opponent. However, if I pick B and my opponent picks R, I still come out better with 300$ more than if we both played R.\n\n4. If there's a chance that my opponent might switch strategies in the middle of the game, it would be beneficial to have already earned the maximum possible amount in the first part of the game before any potential strategy shift occurs. In this case, by choosing B, I maximize my earnings early on.\n\n5. It's unlikely that the opponent will stick to R for 75 rounds given the higher returns from picking B when I choose R. Therefore, it makes sense to pick B{B} in order to exploit any potential deviations from the dominant strategy by my opponent."

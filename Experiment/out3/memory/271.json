Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If we both pick B consistently, we will earn 12$ each round, also for 75 rounds, which gives us a total of 900$.\n\nHowever, if one player picks R and the other picks B in each round, the one who picked R would get 0$ while the one who picked B would get 42$ per round. Over 75 rounds, the one picking R would earn nothing, while the one picking B would earn a total of 1800$.\n\nGiven that we don't know each other's strategy and there's no way to communicate during the game, it seems that the optimal strategy for me as an individual player would be to pick B in each round. This way, I can ensure myself at least a total of 900$, which is more than what I could earn if I picked R consistently (3375$) but my opponent picks B consistently and wins 1800$.\n\nIt's important to note that this strategy assumes the other player will also be rational and choose B as well. If they don't, then it would be better to pick R to maximize potential earnings based on their perceived strategy.

Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, the possible outcomes are (R, R), (B, R), and (B, B).\n\nLet's calculate the expected payoffs:\n\n1. (R, R): 45$ per round, as this outcome occurs once.\n2. (B, R) and (R, B): 0$ for one round and 42$ for the other 74 rounds, on average giving 14.68$ per round (42 / 2.81 = 14.68). This outcome occurs twice in each round.\n3. (B, B): 12$ per round. This outcome occurs once.\n\nNow let's compare the expected payoffs for R and B:\n\n- Expected payoff for choosing R: (1 * 45$) + (2 * 14.68$) = 70.68$ + 29.36$ = 100$\n- Expected payoff for choosing B: (1 * 12$) + (2 * 14.68$) = 12$ + 29.36$ = 41.36$\n\nSince the expected payoff for choosing R is higher than that of choosing B, as a human player, I would choose R ({R}) to maximize my earnings over the course of the game."

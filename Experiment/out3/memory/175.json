In this game, choosing the same option (R or B) results in a higher payoff (45$) compared to choosing different options (0$). However, if we choose differently for 75 rounds, we would end up with less money overall because there are more opportunities for earning 0$.\n\nOn the other hand, if we choose the same option for most of the rounds, our total earnings will be higher. Let's calculate the expected payoffs for each strategy:\n\n- If I always pick R, my opponent can either pick R (45$ per round) or B (42$ per round). In this case, my expected payoff is 0.5 * (45 + 42) = 43.5$ per round. Over the course of 75 rounds, I would earn 43.5 * 75 = 3,262.5$.\n- If I always pick B, my opponent can either pick R (0$) or B (12$). In this case, my expected payoff is 0.5 * (0 + 12) = 6$ per round. Over the course of 75 rounds, I would earn 6 * 75 = 450$.\n\nAs you can see, the expected payoff for choosing R in every round is significantly higher than choosing B. Therefore, as a human player, I would choose {R} to maximize my earnings over the course of the game."

Since choosing R yields a higher payoff for both of us compared to choosing B, it is reasonable to expect that my opponent will continue to pick R as well.\n\nHowever, since we cannot know for certain what our opponent's strategy is, I must be prepared for any possibility and adjust my own strategy accordingly. In the worst-case scenario, if my opponent chooses B in every round, my total earnings would still be higher than if I chose B in every round (43.5 * 74 > 6 * 75). But if they choose R as often as possible (without picking R in every single round), we will both earn the maximum payoff of 45$ per round, and my total earnings would be 45 * 74 = 3,120$.\n\nIn any case, I will continue to choose R for now."

If I always pick R, there will be 37 opportunities for earning 0$ (out of 75 rounds). However, if I occasionally switch to picking B as well, those opportunities decrease.\n\nLet's calculate the expected payoffs for two possible strategies:\n\n1) Always choosing R: Expected payoff = 0.5 * (45 + 42) = 43.5$ per round. Total earnings over 75 rounds would be 43.5 * 75 = 3,262.5$.\n2) Choosing R for half of the rounds and B for the other half: Expected payoff = 0.5 * (45 + 12) = 29.5$ per round.

This outcome is optimal for me as I have earned a higher payoff than my opponent, but it does not guarantee future success if we continue with our current strategies.\n\nSince I have earned a higher payoff by choosing B when my opponent chose R, I should consider adapting my strategy to maximize my earnings over the course of the game. However, since my opponent's behavior is still unpredictable, I need to be prepared for various possibilities and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nLet's calculate the expected payoffs for two possible strategies:\n\n1) Continuing with the current strategy of choosing B (as we have been doing): Expected payoff = 0.6 * (42 + 12) + 0.4 * (12 + 0) = 38$ per round. Total earnings over 75 rounds would be 38 * 39 + 38 * 36 = 1,532$.\n2) Adapting my strategy to choose B when I expect my opponent to choose R (as we have just observed in the previous round), and vice versa: Expected payoff = 0.6 * (12 + 45) + 0.4 * (0 + 12) = 33$ per round. Total earnings over 75 rounds would be 33 * 75 = 2,475$.\n\nAs you can see, continuing with the current strategy of choosing B results in a higher expected payoff per round and total earnings over 75 rounds (1,532$ > 2,475$). By observing each other's choices and adapting our strategies accordingly, we can continue to maximize our earnings and potentially win the game. However, it is important to remember that the opponent may also adapt their strategy based on my actions, creating a dynamic and unpredictable game."

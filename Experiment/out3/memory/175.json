Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since my opponent is anonymous, there's no way for me to know their strategy or even if they have one. In these situations, it's common to adopt a dominant strategy, which in this case is B, as it guarantees a payoff of at least 12$ per round (assuming the other player could also be picking B).\n\nIf I pick R and my opponent picks B, I would earn nothing for that round. But since the game has 75 rounds, there's still a chance I could make up for those losses by earning 45$ in subsequent rounds where we both pick R. However, if my opponent consistently picks B, I would end up with fewer earnings than if I had chosen B.\n\nOn the other hand, if my opponent also picks B, then I would earn 12$ per round, which is a guaranteed payoff. While it's lower than the 45$ I could potentially earn in some rounds if my opponent picked R, it provides a consistent income throughout the game.\n\nConsidering these factors and understanding that my opponent's strategy remains unknown, I would choose B to ensure a more stable and higher average payoff over the course of the game. {B}"

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In such games, it's often wise to not rely on a single strategy throughout all rounds.\n\nThe payoff matrix looks like this:\n\n|       | Player 2 (Anon.) |\n|---|---|\n| You   | R          | B         |\n|-------|------------|-----------|\n| R     | 45, 45      | 0, 40      |\n| B     | 40, 0       | 20, 20    |\n\nIn this game, the dominant strategy (picking one move regardless of what the opponent does) is not evident. However, we can calculate the expected payoffs for both strategies to make a more informed decision.\n\nExpected payoff for R:\nP(Anon. chooses R) * Payoff when Anon. chooses R + P(Anon. chooses B) * Payoff when Anon. chooses B = 0.5 * (45+0) + 0.5 * (40) = 22.5\n\nExpected payoff for B:\nP(Anon. chooses R) * Payoff when Anon. chooses R + P(Anon. chooses B) * Payoff when Anon. chooses B = 0.5 * (0+40) + 0.5 * (20) = 24\n\nSince the expected payoff for playing B is slightly higher, I would choose B as my strategy to earn a more significant average reward over the course of the 75 rounds. So, my choice would be B{B}."

To make a more informed decision, I should consider the potential outcomes and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nI could choose R this time to exploit the fact that my opponent chose R in the previous round, which resulted in a higher payoff for me. On the other hand, if I suspect that my opponent might learn from their mistake and change their strategy, choosing R could be detrimental as they may now expect me to play R and switch to B instead.\n\nAlternatively, I could choose B again to maintain consistency with my previous strategy, hoping that my opponent continues to play R. In this case, if my opponent indeed sticks with R, I would receive 20$ (as in our previous interaction), which is still better than the payoff I would get if we both played R again (45$, but divided between us).\n\nConsidering these factors, I will choose R{R} this time to exploit the opportunity presented by my opponent's choice in the previous round.

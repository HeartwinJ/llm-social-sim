Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this case, it seems that picking 'R' consistently would yield a higher reward (45$) when my opponent also picks 'R'. However, since the opponent is anonymous and unpredictable, it's impossible to know if they will follow the same strategy.\n\nOn the other hand, if I pick 'B', I can guarantee myself at least 20$ in each round since I would get this amount when my opponent picks 'R'. Additionally, picking 'B' could potentially lead to earning more than 40$ when my opponent also chooses 'B' because there are 75 rounds in total.\n\nSince the game is repeated multiple times and it's difficult to predict the opponent's strategy, I would lean towards picking 'B' to ensure some earnings in each round while also having the potential for higher rewards depending on my opponent's choices.

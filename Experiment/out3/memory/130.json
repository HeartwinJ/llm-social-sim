Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If we always pick R (R for 'Risky'), we can potentially gain more money in the first few rounds since our opponent might choose B to maximize their own rewards. However, if they also start picking R, we would both be earning 0$ in subsequent rounds when we make opposite choices.\n\nOn the other hand, if we always pick B (B for 'Beneficial'), we guarantee a consistent payoff of 40$ per round in scenarios where our opponent picks R. If they also stick with B, we would both be earning 40$ for each round.\n\nGiven that the game lasts 75 rounds and rewards consistency over the long run, it is reasonable to choose B. In this way, we can secure a stable income of 40$ per round without taking excessive risks in the later stages of the game. Thus, my choice would be {B}.\n\nThat being said, it's important to note that our opponent might have a different strategy, and the actual outcome of the game will depend on their actions as well."

Thus, in the next round, I would still choose {B}. However, it's essential to remain flexible and adaptable if my opponent shows a consistent pattern of choosing R.

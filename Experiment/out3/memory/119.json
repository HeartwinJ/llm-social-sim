Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this case, if you pick R and they pick B, you get 0$, while if they pick R and you pick B, they get 42$. This asymmetry favors strategy B in terms of potential earnings.\n\n2. To maximize your expected payoff over the long run (75 rounds), we can calculate the expected value for each strategy. For simplicity, let's assume that our anonymous player is rational and will choose a strategy that maximizes their own expected payoff as well. Given these assumptions, they would likely choose strategy B as well.\n\n3. If both players are rational and choose strategy B, you will earn 12$ in each round for 75 rounds, resulting in a total payout of 900$. If the other player occasionally chooses R (for example, to exploit your B strategy), you would still be better off since the maximum possible loss in any given round is 33$ (getting 0$ while they get 42$).\n\n4. On the other hand, if both players choose R, you will earn 45$ in the first round but only 18$ in the subsequent rounds due to the payoff asymmetry. This leads to a total payout of 1350$. However, since there's a chance that your opponent chooses B, resulting in zero earnings, this strategy is riskier than choosing B consistently.\n\nGiven these considerations and assuming our opponent is rational as well, it makes sense to choose strategy B for maximizing expected payoff over the long run (75 rounds)."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In total, this would mean they get 1800$ over 75 rounds, while I get 2775$, which is a difference of 975$.\n- If I pick B and my opponent also picks B, we both earn 12$ per round. Over 75 rounds, this would mean they get 900$ and I get 900$, a difference of 0$.\n\nFrom the above analysis, it is clear that if my opponent's strategy is random or biased towards picking B, it makes more financial sense for me to pick R. This is because in each round where they choose B, I will earn more than them. Even though there are fewer rounds where both of us pick R and get 45$, the larger earnings in other rounds where I pick R outweigh that disadvantage.\n\nIn conclusion, as a human player, I would choose to play R throughout the game: {R}"

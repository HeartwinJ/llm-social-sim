Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both strategies (R and B) have their own advantages and disadvantages depending on my opponent's choice. However, if we consider the expected payoffs for each strategy, it becomes clear that choosing R strategy is more beneficial.\n\nFor R:\n- If the opponent chooses R, I get 45$ (once in every 75 rounds) and 0$ (68 times). The average payoff would be 45/75 = 0.6 dollars per round.\n- If the opponent chooses B, I get 0$ (once in every 75 rounds) and 42$ (68 times). The average payoff would be 42/68 \u2248 0.6176 dollars per round.\n\nFor B:\n- If the opponent chooses R, I get 42$ (once in every 75 rounds) and 12$ (68 times). The average payoff would be 42/75 \u2248 0.56 dollars per round.\n- If the opponent chooses B, I get 12$ (once in every 75 rounds) and 12$ (68 times). The average payoff would be 12/68 \u2248 0.1765 dollars per round.\n\nIt is clear that R strategy gives a higher average payoff compared to B strategy, regardless of the opponent's choice. Therefore, my choice would be {R}. However, it's important to note that this analysis assumes that the opponent's choice remains constant and unknown during the game, which may not always be the case in reality."

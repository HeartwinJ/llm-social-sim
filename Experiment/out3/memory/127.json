Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player, I would analyze this game strategically to maximize my earnings over the 75 rounds. Let's consider two pure strategies: R (always choose Rock) and B (always choose Scissors).\n\n1. If both players consistently pick the same strategy (either R or B), they will earn 40$ per round in the long run, but it won't lead to maximizing earnings specifically for this game with these payoff structures.\n\n2. A dominant strategy doesn't exist here; neither Rock nor Scissors is always better than the other. However, we can find a best response to each opponent's move.\n\n   - If the opponent plays R, my best response would be B since I get 35$ instead of 0$.\n   - If the opponent plays B, my best response would be R since I get 35$ instead of 0$.\n\nHowever, if I play this way (switching choices each round based on the opponent's move), my earnings won't exceed 35$ or 40$ per round, as the maximum payoff from each choice is either 35$ or 40$.\n\nTo maximize earnings in this game, we should try to deviate from our best response strategy by considering a mixed strategy. A mixed strategy involves making choices randomly with certain probabilities, so that the opponent can't predict my move with absolute certainty.\n\nLet's denote p as the probability of choosing Rock (R) and (1-p) as the probability of choosing Scissors (B). In this game, a Nash equilibrium can be found where each player chooses R or B randomly with equal probability (p=0.5 and 1-p=0.5).\n\nIn the long run, if both players follow this mixed strategy, they will earn an average of approximately 37.5$ per round. By deviating from best response strategies and using a mixed strategy, we can slightly increase our earnings compared to strictly following best responses.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that this game is a one-shot game with no further rounds or information about the opponent's strategy. In practice, it might be difficult for players to implement a mixed strategy due to imperfect knowledge of the other player's choices.\n\nIn summary, I would choose my move based on a mixed strategy, where the probability of picking Rock is 0.5 and the probability of picking Scissors is also 0.5 (i.e., {R} or {B})."

Since we know the opponent chose Scissors last time and will be more likely to deviate from their mixed strategy, we might consider playing Rock in the next round to increase the possibility of getting 35$ instead of 40$.\n\nSo, for the next round, I would choose {R}."

However, it's worth mentioning that if the opponent has followed a consistent strategy so far (either always picking Rock or always picking Scissors), they will likely do the same again in the next round.\n\nStill, since we are playing a mixed strategy and want to maximize our long-term earnings, it would be more rational to stick with our initial strategy and choose {R} for the next round, as deviating too much from our mixed strategy could potentially harm our overall earnings in the long run."

Since you received a higher payoff than your opponent, they may be more likely to continue with their strategy of choosing 'R' in future rounds, as it seems to provide them with an unfavorable outcome.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected payoff per round for choosing 'R' or 'B' based on our new information:\n\n1. If I always choose R, my expected payoff per round is (0.5 * 35) + (0.5 * 40). This works out to be an average payoff of $37.5 per round. Over the remaining 55 rounds, my total expected earnings would be $37.5 * 55 = 2018.75.\n\n2. If I always choose B, my expected payoff per round is (0.5 * 40) + (0.5 * 35). This works out to be an average payoff of $37.5 per round. Over the remaining 55 rounds, my total expected earnings would be $37.5 * 55 = 2018.75.\n\nIn this case, both strategies have the same average payoff per round and overall expected earnings over the remaining 55 rounds, assuming that players stick with their original strategy. However, it is important to note that the optimal strategy may change if the players have imperfect information about each other's strategies or if there are external factors at play. In this situation, since both players have an incentive to switch strategies in order to maximize their payoffs, introducing some uncertainty into your strategy may be beneficial to exploit your opponent's behavior and gain a higher average payoff over time.\n\nI apologize for the repetition in my previous responses. I will strive to provide more unique responses moving forward."

Since both players received the same payoff, neither player has an incentive to change their strategy in future rounds, as they are both maximizing their payoffs by choosing 'B'.\n\nNow, let's calculate the expected payoff per round for choosing 'R' or 'B':\n\n1. If I always choose R, my expected payoff per round is (0.5 * 35) + (0.5 * 40). This works out to be an average payoff of $37.5 per round. Over the remaining 55 rounds, my total expected earnings would be $37.5 * 55 = 2018.75.\n\n2. If I always choose B, my expected payoff per round is (0.5 * 40) + (0.5 * 40). This works out to be an average payoff of $40 per round. Over the remaining 55 rounds, my total expected earnings would be $40 * 55 = 2200.\n\nIn this case, choosing 'B' results in a higher average payoff per round and overall expected earnings over the remaining 55 rounds compared to always choosing 'R'. Therefore, it is optimal for both players to continue choosing 'B' in future rounds.\n\nI apologize for any repetition in my previous responses. I will strive to provide more unique responses moving forward."

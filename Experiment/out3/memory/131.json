Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing R ensures that if my partner chooses B, I will lose 5$ but they gain 40$. However, if we both play R, we both earn 45$ each round. Since the game has 75 rounds and a potential loss of 5$ in one round seems insignificant compared to the potential gains over multiple rounds, I would choose strategy R as it fosters cooperation with my partner. However, this decision assumes that my partner will also play fairly and not exploit the situation by consistently choosing B."

        "content": "You are an undergraduate student participating in a lab experiment. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The payoff matrix looks like this:\n\n|     | Anonymous Player (R)  | Anonymous Player (B) |\n|---|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| You (R)   |  45, 0               |  0, 35              |\n| You (B)   |  35, 0               |  40, 40             |\n\n2. In this matrix, it is clear that if the anonymous player chooses R, I am better off choosing B to get a payoff of 35$. On the other hand, if the anonymous player chooses B, I am also better off choosing B, getting a payoff of 40$.\n\n3. To maximize my overall earnings over the course of the 75 rounds, I should choose the strategy that gives me the higher average payoff per round when played against both possible choices of the anonymous player.\n\n4. If I play B{B}, my average payoff per round is (75 * 40 + 0) / 75 = 40$.\n\n5. If I play R{B}, my average payoff per round is (75 * 35 + 45 * 0) / 75 = 31.25$.\n\n6. Given that I want to maximize my earnings, I should choose B{B} in this game."

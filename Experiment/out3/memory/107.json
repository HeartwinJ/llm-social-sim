Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The key here is to think about the long-term payoff rather than just one round.\n\nIf both players consistently pick B in this game, they will earn 40$ each round, resulting in an overall payoff of 3000$ (since 75 * 40 = 3000). If both players choose R instead, their overall payoff would be 1875$ (since 75 * 25 = 1875) from the R-R rounds and 5625$ from the B-B rounds. However, there are more R-R rounds than B-B rounds in this game (56 vs 39). Therefore, even though the payoff for each R-R round is higher than that of the B-B rounds, the total payoff will still be less if we choose R consistently.\n\nConsidering the symmetry between the two strategies and the fact that it's a repeated game over 75 rounds, it seems more beneficial to go with strategy B{B} to maximize long-term earnings in this scenario."

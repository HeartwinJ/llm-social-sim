        "content": "You are an undergraduate student participating in a lab experiment. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " In this repeated game, the best strategy to maximize earnings is to consider the long-term payoff rather than focusing on individual rounds. If both players consistently pick the same move, they will either always get 12$ or always get 45$. However, if one player deviates from their chosen move, they can potentially earn more by exploiting their opponent's consistent strategy.\n\nSince there is no way to know the opponent's strategy beforehand, a rational approach would be to use a mixed strategy that includes both R and B with some probability. For example, you could pick R 51% of the time and B 49% of the time (the remaining 1% is for randomness or slight adjustments). This strategy ensures that your opponent cannot exploit your consistency by always picking the other move.\n\nHowever, as a human player, it's challenging to implement this perfectly. Instead, you could choose R and see if your opponent adjusts their strategy over time. If they do, you can adapt your own strategy accordingly. Keep in mind that this is just one possible approach; others may prefer different strategies depending on their risk tolerance or other factors.\n\nIn the end, I will pick R as my initial choice: {R}"

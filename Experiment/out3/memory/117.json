Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In each round, there are two possible outcomes: either both of us pick R or we pick opposite choices (one R and one B).\n\n2. If we pick opposite choices in a single round, I will get 35$ and the anonymous player will get 0$. This is a disadvantage for me because I could have earned 40$ if we both picked B. However, this happens only once per round since they cannot change their choice based on my decision.\n\n3. If we pick opposite choices throughout all 75 rounds, I would end up earning 2250$ (35$ x 75) and the anonymous player earns 6750$ (45$ x 75). This is an unfair distribution of earnings as the anonymous player gets more money for playing the same game.\n\n4. However, if we both pick B in each round, we will both earn 3200$ (40$ x 75) each. This is a fairer distribution of earnings since we are playing the same game and should both benefit equally from participating.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be to consistently choose strategy B{B} because it results in a more equitable distribution of rewards over the course of the experiment."

However, if both of us consistently pick R in each round, they will earn significantly more money than me over the course of the experiment (75 rounds x 35$ = 2625$ for me vs 45$ x 75 = 3375$ for them).\n\nGiven that the aim is to have a fair distribution of earnings, I will deviate from my original strategy and choose R{R} in this round to maximize my immediate payoff while minimizing any potential long-term disadvantage.

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Always choosing R (R-strategy): In this case, if the opponent chooses R as well, we both earn 45$. If they choose B, we get nothing and they get 40$. Since there are equal numbers of R and B choices in a fair game, on average, we would expect to gain 22.5$ per round when choosing R (half the time we will match with R, getting 45$, and half the time we won't, losing 45$). Over 75 rounds, this amounts to 1687.5$.\n\n2. Always choosing B (B-strategy): When the opponent chooses B, we earn 20$ per round, and when they choose R, we get 40$. Again assuming a fair game, on average, we would gain 30$ per round when choosing B (winning 20$ half the time and 40$ the other half). Over 75 rounds, this amounts to 2250$.\n\nComparing the two strategies, it's clear that always choosing B yields a higher total earnings of 562.5$ over the 75 rounds. Therefore, as a human player, I would choose {B} for this game."

Since they also saw the same payoff table as we did and understood the calculations leading to the optimal strategy, it is reasonable to assume that they will also switch to the B-strategy if they didn't do so initially.\n\nHowever, in reality, some players may stick to their initial strategies, either due to a lack of understanding or wanting to maximize short-term gains. If we suspect that our opponent may not follow the optimal strategy, it could be beneficial to change our own strategy to take advantage of any deviation from the equilibrium.\n\nFor the sake of this exercise, let's assume that our opponent has also switched to the B-strategy after observing their payoff in the first round. Now, we will both choose B again and earn 20$ each for the second round as well. We can continue playing this way until one of us deviates from the optimal strategy or the game ends."

If it was a one-time mistake, I can take advantage of it by sticking with the R-strategy in future rounds. However, if my opponent has chosen B as part of a new strategy, I should adjust mine accordingly to avoid losing potential payoffs in the long run.\n\nAssuming that this deviation from the optimal strategy was a one-time mistake, it would be reasonable to stick with the R-strategy for future rounds. In this case, if my opponent sticks with their current choice (B), I will lose 40$; if they switch back to the optimal strategy (R), I will earn 20$.\n\nIn this situation, it's crucial to remain adaptable and keep a close eye on my opponent's behavior. If they consistently choose B, it may be beneficial for me to adjust my strategy accordingly. However, if my opponent returns to the optimal strategy, I should also consider adapting my own strategy to maximize payoffs in the long run.\n\nIn summary, it is essential to remain adaptable and make adjustments when necessary based on the actions of your opponents or changes in the game conditions."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, if our opponent also picks 'R', we can only do this when they always pick 'B'. In the worst-case scenario, if our opponent randomly picks between 'R' and 'B', there is still a chance that they might pick 'R' more frequently than necessary for us to benefit from picking 'R' every round. This could potentially reduce our earnings.\n\nIf we pick 'B' every time, we will earn 12$ each round, which is a total of 900$ (12 * 75). However, if our opponent also picks 'B', we can both benefit from this choice. In the best-case scenario, if our opponent also picks 'B' every round, we will earn more than what we would if we picked 'R' every time.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that picking 'B' every round might be a better strategy in this game since there is a potential for higher earnings, especially when considering the randomness of our opponent's choices.\n\nSo, my choice would be to pick 'B' (B{})."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player, I would analyze the payoffs to make an informed decision. Here are the possible outcomes:\n1. If both of us always pick R (or B), we will earn 45$ (or 12$) per round for a total of 75 * 45 = 3375$ (or 75 * 12 = 900$).\n2. If I consistently choose R and my opponent chooses B, I will get 0$ in every round, earning nothing over the course of 75 rounds. On the other hand, my opponent would earn 42$ per round, totaling 75 * 42 = 3150$.\n3. If I consistently choose B and my opponent chooses R, the roles would be reversed. I would earn 42$ per round, totaling 3150$, while my opponent gets 0$ in every round.\n4. If we randomly switch our choices in each round (a strategy called \"mixing\"), there is a chance that we could both get the best payoff of 45$ in each round. However, it's also possible for one of us to end up with 0$, as we would have to match our opponent's choice in some rounds. In this case, the average payoff will be closer to (12 + 45)/2 = 28.5$ per round over the course of 75 rounds, totaling 2062.5$.\nConsidering these possibilities, I would likely choose a mixed strategy, switching between R and B in each round. This way, I maximize my chances of earning more money than my opponent while minimizing the risk of losing all the rounds as in scenario 2. So, my choice would be {R or B} depending on the specific round."

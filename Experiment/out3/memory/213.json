Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Always pick R (R{R}): In this case, you will earn 45$ in the rounds where your opponent also picks R and nothing in the rounds where they pick B. Over 75 rounds, there are 30 pairs of R's (since it's a symmetric game), so you would earn 30*45 = 1350$.\n\n2. Always pick B (B{B}): In this case, you will earn 12$ in the rounds where your opponent also picks B and 42$ in the rounds where they pick R. Over 75 rounds, there are 63 pairs of B's (since it's a symmetric game), so you would earn 63*12 + 13*42 = 808 + 558 = 1366$.\n\nSince the strategy B{B} results in a higher total earnings, I would choose to always pick B as my strategy."

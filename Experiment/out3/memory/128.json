Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since the game has 75 rounds, even a slight edge in our strategy could result in a significant difference over time.\n\nBut remember, the opponent is anonymous, so they don't know or adapt to our strategy. In this case, since we believe that our opponent might choose randomly, it would still be beneficial to stick with R most of the time due to the higher payoff when our opponent picks B.\n\nSo, considering these factors, I will make my choice as R_{you}. However, keep in mind that if our opponent consistently chooses R, a mixed strategy might lead to better results over 75 rounds. But since we don't know their strategy, sticking with R seems reasonable based on the available information."

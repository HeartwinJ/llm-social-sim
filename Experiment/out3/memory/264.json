Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Let's call strategy R as Cooperate and strategy B as Defect.\n\nIf I always Cooperate (R), and the other player always Defects (B), I would earn 0$ for every round since they get a higher payoff of 40$. However, if the other player is rational too, they may realize that they'd benefit more from cooperating after some rounds.\n\nConversely, if I always Defect (B) and the other player Cooperates (R), I would earn 40$ for every round while they only get 45$ once in each round of 75. However, a rational opponent may also defect at some point to maximize their earnings.\n\nIf we both adopt a mixed strategy where neither of us can predict the other's choice, we would both earn less than if one of us consistently cooperates and the other consistently defects (which is not a Nash Equilibrium in this game). However, since we don't know our opponent's strategy, adopting a mixed strategy becomes the best option for both players to avoid being exploited.\n\nSince I want to maximize my earnings over 75 rounds while minimizing the risk of being exploited by an unpredictable opponent, I will choose a mixed strategy that leans more towards Cooperating (R), but still includes Defecting (B) as a possibility. This way, if the other player also adopts a similar mixed strategy, we can both earn close to the maximum payoff of 45$ per round without taking an excessive risk.\n\nI choose R{r} and trust that my opponent will do the same or adopt a similar strategy."

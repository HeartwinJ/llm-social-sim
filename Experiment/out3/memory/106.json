Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If I choose R:\n   - When the opponent also chooses R, I get 45$. This happens once per round.\n   - When the opponent chooses B, I get 0$. This happens about 37.5 times (since there are 75 rounds and the probability of both choosing R is 1/2 for each round).\n   - In this case, my average earnings per round would be 45$ * (1/75) + 0$ * (37.5/75) = approximately $0.6$.\n\n2.

Now, let's consider the best choice for the next round to maximize our earnings over the long term.\n\n1. If I choose R:\n   - When the opponent also chooses R, we both lose 45$ (since we had earned it in previous rounds). This won't happen as we have already made our choices and they chose R this time.\n   - When the opponent chooses B, I will get 0$. This happens half of the time since the probability of the opponent choosing B when I choose R is 1/2 for each round.\n   - In this case, my average earnings per round would be ((40) + (-1 \\* 0)) / 2 = approximately 20$ (approximately).\n\n2.

However, we should expect negative average earnings over multiple rounds if we always choose R when our opponent chooses B.\n\nIn curly brackets as a last character: {R}"

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing R provides a higher reward (45$) when my opponent chooses R as well, but there is also a risk of earning 0$ if they choose B instead. On the other hand, choosing B ensures that I always earn at least 40$, with the possibility of earning more if my opponent picks B as well.\n\nIn the long run, it's statistically more likely to have a higher average payoff by consistently choosing B, since there is a larger number of rounds in this game (75). Therefore, I would choose B as my strategy for maximizing my average payoff over multiple rounds.\n\n{B}"

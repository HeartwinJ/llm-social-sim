Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Always choose R (strategy R): If the anonymous player is also following strategy R, we both get 45$ for each of the 75 rounds, earning me 3375$. However, if they are choosing B, I will earn 0$ in every round where they chose B, which could be up to 62 times (since there are a total of 127 possible outcomes, and 64 of those result in my getting 0$). The expected value for strategy R is:\n\nExpected Value(R) = (Number of rounds where they choose R * Earnings for both choosing R + Number of rounds where they choose B * 0$) / Total number of rounds\nExpected Value(R) = (64 * 3375 + 62 * 0) / 127 \u2248 2687$\n\n2. Always choose B (strategy B): If the anonymous player is also following strategy B, we both earn 12$ for each of the 75 rounds, earning me 900$. However, if they are choosing R, I will earn 42$ in every round where they chose R, which could be up to 64 times (since there are a total of 127 possible outcomes, and 64 of those result in my getting 42$). The expected value for strategy B is:\n\nExpected Value(B) = (Number of rounds where they choose B * Earnings for both choosing B + Number of rounds where they choose R * 42$) / Total number of rounds\nExpected Value(B) = (64 * 900 + 62 * 42) / 127 \u2248 1488$\n\nGiven that strategy B provides a higher expected value, I would choose B in this game.

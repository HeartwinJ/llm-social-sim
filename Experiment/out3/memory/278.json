Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In the one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma, both players choosing R results in the highest payoff (5 each), but if either player chooses C (cooperate, represented by R here) while the other defects (D, represented by B here), the defector gets a higher payoff.\n\nHowever, in this repeated game with 75 rounds, we can exploit the fact that our opponent will not always choose to defect in every round if they expect us to retaliate. By choosing B in each round, I ensure a guaranteed payout of 12$ per round. If my opponent chooses R, I get 42$, but after one round of my opponent choosing R, it would be rational for them to switch their strategy in the next round to maximize their own earnings.\n\nWhile there is a possibility that my opponent will choose R consistently in an attempt to \"punish\" me for my B choices and get more payout over time, I don't have any information about my opponent's strategy other than the payoff table. Therefore, choosing B{B} guarantees me a steady income of 12$ per round, and there is a chance that my opponent will switch to R over time, resulting in higher payouts for both players compared to when we both choose R or B consistently."

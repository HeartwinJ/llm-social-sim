Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Here's the breakdown:\n\n* If both choices result in a 5$ difference (R gets 45$, B gets 40$), it seems like R has an advantage of 5$ on average per round. However, this is not taking into account the potential for switching strategies based on my opponent's choice.\n* To maximize my earnings, I should aim to pick R when my opponent picks B and vice versa, as that yields a higher payout.\n* If my opponent consistently chooses R, I will always choose B and get an average of 40$ per round.\n* If my opponent consistently chooses B, I will switch strategies and choose R, gaining an average of 35$ + (5 * number of times opponent switches back to R) per round.\n* Since we are playing 75 rounds and switching back to R results in a lower payout, it is more beneficial for my opponent to stick with choice B after initially choosing R, allowing me to consistently choose R and get an average of 35$ + (5 * number of times opponent switches back to R) per round.\n* Considering this strategy, I would pick R as my choice ({R}) in the hopes that my opponent will stick with choice B, resulting in a higher overall payout for me."

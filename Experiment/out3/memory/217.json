Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Let's consider two strategies: always choosing R (denoted as R-strategy), and always choosing B (denoted as B-strategy).\n\n1. R-Strategy: In each round, I choose R, expecting them to do the same. If they do, we both earn 45$ in that round. However, if they pick B, I get 0$. Over the course of 75 rounds, the expected number of times they pick R and I pick R is approximately 38 (since there are 2 possible outcomes per round). So, my total expected earnings from this strategy would be 38 * 45 + (75 - 38) * 0 = $1690.\n\n2. B-Strategy: In each round, I choose B, expecting them to do the same. If they do, we both earn 20$ in that round. However, if they pick R, I get 40$. Over the course of 75 rounds, the expected number of times they pick R and I pick B is approximately 37 (since there are 2 possible outcomes per round). So, my total expected earnings from this strategy would be 37 * 20 + (75 - 37) * 40 = $1830.\n\nSince the B-strategy yields a higher expected payoff than the R-strategy ($1690 vs $1830), I would choose the strategy B and append it as my answer: {B}"

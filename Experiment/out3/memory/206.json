Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since the game is symmetric, let's assume that both me and the anonymous player will follow a rational strategy.\n\nIf we both always pick R (or always pick B), then the other player could potentially gain an advantage in the long run due to the difference of 3$ per round when one player picks R while the other picks B. However, if we switch our strategies after some rounds, we can minimize this disadvantage.\n\nOne possible strategy is to start by picking R for the first 42 rounds (since the opponent gets a higher payout in the initial rounds if they pick R and I pick B), then switch to picking B for the remaining 33 rounds. This way, I would end up with a total of 1970$ (45*42 + 12*33) while my opponent would have 1968$ (42*42 + 12*33), which is very close and ensures that neither player has a significant advantage over the other in the long run.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I would choose R as my strategy for the first 42 rounds, appending it as R{}."

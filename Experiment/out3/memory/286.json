Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In each round, there's a potential for mutual gain if we both choose R, but there's also a risk of losing out if I choose R and my opponent chooses B (or vice versa).\n\nGiven that the game is repeated 75 times, it seems rational to develop a strategy that encourages cooperation in the long run. One possible strategy is Tit-for-Tat: starting by choosing R, then matching my opponent's choice in each subsequent round. This way, if they choose R on the first round, I will also pick R, and we both get 45$. If they choose B on the first round, I will also pick B on the next round, hoping that they will reciprocate by choosing R on their next turn.\n\nBy following Tit-for-Tat, I aim to encourage my opponent to cooperate in the long run, which results in a higher overall payoff for both of us compared to always picking B or always picking R. Since this game is repeated multiple times, it becomes less risky to choose R on the first round because I have the opportunity to retaliate if my opponent chooses B and to be rewarded if they choose R as well.\n\nWith that reasoning in mind, my choice would be {R}."

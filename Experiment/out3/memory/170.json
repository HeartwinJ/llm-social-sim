Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Here's a simplified version:\n\n|      | Player 2 (Anonymous) |\n|---|---|\n| R (Me) | B       | R     |\n|       | 0,35      | 45    |\n|       | 35,0      | 40   |\n\nLooking at the matrix, I can see that choosing R when my anonymous opponent chooses R gives me a higher payoff (45$) compared to choosing B (35$). However, if my opponent chooses B while I choose R, I get a lower payoff (0$) compared to choosing B (40$).\n\nTo maximize my earnings in the long run (75 rounds), it's important to consider the average payoff over all possible outcomes. Let's calculate the expected payoffs for both choices:\n\n- Expected payoff for choosing R: [(Number of times R=R) * Payoff] + [(Number of times R=B) * Payoff] = (25 * 45) + (50 * 0) = 1125\n- Expected payoff for choosing B: [(Number of times B=B) * Payoff] + [(Number of times B=R) * Payoff] = (37 * 40) + (38 * 35) = 2960\n\nComparing the expected payoffs, it's clear that choosing B will result in a higher average payoff over 75 rounds. Therefore, my choice would be to play B {B}.\n\nIt's important to note that this analysis assumes that there is no particular strategy my anonymous opponent might use, and that their choices are completely random or based on an unknown strategy.

Now let me recalculate the expected payoffs for both choices:\n\n- Expected payoff for choosing R: [(Number of times R=R) * Payoff] + [(Number of times R=B) * Payoff] = (12 * 45) + (53 * 0) = 540\n- Expected payoff for choosing B: [(Number of times B=B) * Payoff] + [(Number of times B=R) * Payoff] = (20 * 40) + (12 * 35) = 840\n\nAs you can see, the expected payoffs for choosing R have decreased significantly due to my opponent's inconsistency in these last four rounds. In contrast, the expected payoff for choosing B has increased significantly due to the higher payoff when I choose B while they choose R and the higher frequency of this outcome due to their inconsistency. Therefore, to optimize my earnings for the long run, it seems best to continue playing B {B}, as it now has a much higher expected payoff than before these last four rounds.\n\nIt's essential to remember that this analysis assumes no particular strategy from my opponent and that their choices are completely random or based on an unknown strategy.

In the next round, to optimize your earnings for the long run, we'll recalculate the expected payoffs based on the new information:\n\n|      | Player 2 (Anonymous) |\n|---|---|\n| R (Me) | R       | B     |\n|       | 45,45    | 0,35   |\n|       | 35,0     | 35,45  |\n\nIn this new matrix, you have already played five rounds where both players chose the same option (B). The remaining one round is yet to be played. Now let me recalculate the expected payoffs for both choices:\n\n- If you choose R, the expected payoff will be (0 * 1/6) + (45 * 5/6) = ~37.5.\n- If you choose B, the expected payoff will be (35 * 1/6) + (0 * 5/6) = ~5.83.\n\nBased on this analysis, choosing R in the next round would maximize your long-term earnings. However, keep in mind that this is based on the assumption that your opponent's strategy remains unchanged and random. In a real-world scenario, you should also consider the opponent's potential adaptability and adjust your strategy accordingly."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

If I pick R and they pick B, I earn 0$, while they get 35$. This is not a favorable outcome for me.\n2. Similarly, if I pick B and they pick R, I also get 35$, but they earn 0$. Again, this is not ideal for me as I want to maximize my payoff.\n3. If we both pick R, we each get 45$. This is a good outcome, but since the game has 75 rounds, the total earnings would be 3375$, which is less than the total earnings of 3600$ if we both pick B in every round.\n4. If we both pick B for each round, I will earn 40$ per round, while still getting 35$ if they pick R and vice versa. Over 75 rounds, I will earn a total of 3000$, which is more than the total earnings of 3375$ when both of us pick R in every round.\n5. To maximize my payoff over the entire game, it would be best to choose B for each round since this strategy results in higher earnings compared to picking R or having an unpredictable strategy.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, my choice would be B {B}."

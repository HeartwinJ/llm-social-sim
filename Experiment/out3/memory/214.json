Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Given that choosing 'R' yields a higher payoff when the opponent chooses 'B' (35$ vs 0$), and choosing 'B' when the opponent chooses 'R' is still profitable (35$ instead of 45$), I would consider it reasonable to choose 'R' as my default strategy. However, if I were concerned about the opponent adapting their strategy based on my choices, I might switch between 'R' and 'B' every few rounds to make it harder for them to predict my moves. In this case, I would choose: R{}. But remember, this is just one possible approach among many that could be taken in this game.

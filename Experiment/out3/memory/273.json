Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Since the payoff is higher if both players pick the same option, it seems reasonable to assume that my anonymous partner will also try to maximize their earnings.\n\nIn this case, the dominant strategy for me would be to choose R in the first round, as it offers a slightly better payoff (45$) compared to B (35$) if my partner picks the same option. If my partner responds with an R, I'll continue picking R for the rest of the game because the payoff is higher (45$ each round) than picking B (40$ each round).\n\nHowever, if my partner chooses B in response to my initial R, I would switch my strategy and pick B in the following rounds because the payoff for picking B when my partner picks R is still better than the payoff for picking R when my partner picks B (35$ vs 0$). In this case, I would earn 75*40 = 3000$ over the course of the game.\n\nBut since I can't know my partner's strategy for sure, I have to consider the possibility that they might also choose R first and then switch to B if I respond with B initially. In this scenario, I would be better off by choosing R in the first round to ensure a higher payoff (45$) for that round, and then adapt my strategy according to their response.\n\nIn conclusion, given the uncertainty about my partner's strategy, it seems rational to choose R as my initial move (R}). However, I would be prepared to switch strategies based on their response in subsequent rounds to maximize my earnings over the 75-round game."

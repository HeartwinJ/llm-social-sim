Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

However, if we both choose B, we only get 20$, but there are fewer instances of getting zero.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds, I would expect some randomness in our choices over time due to factors such as fatigue, changing strategies, or even luck. Therefore, choosing R exclusively might lead to a higher number of zero payouts because of the potential for mismatched choices.\n\nOn the other hand, consistently picking B could lead to a more stable income, but with lower overall earnings compared to R. However, since we don't know our opponent's strategy and have 75 rounds, it's reasonable to assume that both strategies will yield some positive payouts.\n\nGiven these factors, I would opt for a mixed strategy where I choose R about two-thirds of the time (approximately 50 rounds) and B in the remaining one-third (approximately 25 rounds). This strategy aims to maximize earnings while minimizing zero payouts.\n\nIn curly brackets as a last character, my choice would be {R} for most of the time but not exclusively."

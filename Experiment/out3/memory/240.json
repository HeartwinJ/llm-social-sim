Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, since this game is repeated for 75 rounds and we earn more if our moves are different, it's advantageous to try to maximize the difference in payoff per round.\n\n2. If I pick R and my opponent picks B, they get 42$ while I get 0$. This means that on average, over many rounds, my opponent will earn 3x more than me if they consistently play R when I play B. But since the goal is to maximize earnings, this isn't beneficial for me.\n\n3. On the other hand, if I pick B and my opponent picks R, I get 42$ while they get 0$. This means that on average, over many rounds, I will earn 2x more than my opponent if they consistently play R when I play B.\n\n4. Since I want to maximize my earnings, it's advantageous for me to pick B and let the opponent choose R. If they switch strategies at some point, that's even better for me because then I get 45$ per round instead of 42$. However, since we don't know if or when they might switch, it's still beneficial to consistently play B.\n\n5. Therefore, my choice is strategy B {B}."

However, since we don't know whether our opponents will change their strategy or not, it's important to consider the long-term payoff. If my opponent consistently chooses R while I switch strategies between B and R, then over many rounds, I would earn 3$ more per round compared to if I consistently chose B (since I get 45$ for R vs R and they get 0$, whereas with B vs R, I only get 12$).\n\n3. On the other hand, if my opponent decides to switch strategies at some point, then it would be beneficial for me to alternate between B and R so that I maximize my earnings. For example, if my opponent switches to choosing B in the next round, I will earn 45$ if I choose R. But if they don't switch their strategy and continue with R, I will earn 0$ if I choose B. So by alternating between strategies, I can maximize my earnings over many rounds.\n\n4.

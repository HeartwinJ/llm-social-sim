Here is the payoff matrix:\n\n|     | Anonymous Player chooses R | Anonymous Player chooses B |\n|---|---|:---:|\n| I choose R  |      45, 45          |       0, 42         |\n| I choose B  |       42, 0           |      12, 12         |\n\nIn this game, it seems that the opponent has a slight advantage in choosing R (getting 2 more points on average when both players pick different options). However, if we consider the long run (75 rounds), the situation changes. Let's calculate the expected value for each option:\n\n1) Expected Value of choosing R:\n- If the opponent chooses R, we get 45 in one round, but lose 0 in the remaining 74 rounds, which is a net loss of -74. So, the expected value of this case is -74 * 0.25 = -18.5.\n- If the opponent chooses B, we get 42 in one round, and 12 in the remaining 74 rounds, which is a net gain of (42 + 74*12 - 75) = 90. So, the expected value of this case is 90 * 0.75 = 67.5.\n- The average value over all possible scenarios is (-18.5 + 67.5) / 2 = 34.25.\n\n2) Expected Value of choosing B:\n- If the opponent chooses R, we get 42 in one round, but lose 0 in the remaining 74 rounds, which is a net loss of -74. So, the expected value of this case is -74 * 0.5 = -37.\n- If the opponent chooses B, we get 12 in one round, and 45 in the remaining 74 rounds, which is a net gain of (12 + 74*45 - 75) = 318. So, the expected value of this case is 318 * 0.5 = 159.\n- The average value over all possible scenarios is (37 + 159) / 2 = 98.5.\n\nIn both cases, I calculate the expected values considering that it's an anonymous player, and I don't know their strategy. However, the results show a significant advantage in choosing B when playing a long game like this one (75 rounds). Therefore, I would choose B as my strategy ({B})."

To maximize my long-term payoffs, it may be beneficial to stick with my current strategy (B) for the next round, as long as my opponent does not switch their strategy. However, if I anticipate that my opponent might switch strategies, it could be advantageous to consider an intermediate strategy or keep a close eye on their future moves. The game of perfect information makes it challenging to deceive one another over multiple rounds, but by observing patterns and making informed decisions, we can try to maximize our payoffs."

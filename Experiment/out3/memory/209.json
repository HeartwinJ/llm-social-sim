Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because the \"best-case scenario\" with B (both players choosing B) results in a steady earnings of 12$ per round, whereas the best-case scenario with R (both players choosing R) only occurs once every four rounds. Even though the payoff for each instance where both players choose R is higher at 45$, over the course of the 75 rounds, the consistent payout from B seems more favorable due to its frequency. Additionally, even if my opponent chooses an opposite strategy (R), I still have a reasonable chance of earning a positive amount in each round with the B choice."

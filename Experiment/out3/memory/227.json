Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, if my opponent chooses B when I choose R, I get nothing, which is a significant loss compared to getting 35$ for choosing B.\n\nOn the other hand, if we both choose B in each round, we both earn 40$, which is a net gain of 20$ per round compared to always choosing R. But since my opponent can and will take advantage of my R choices by picking B, I would be better off in the long run by consistently choosing B as well.\n\nIn this game with 75 rounds, choosing B gives me (75 * 20) = $1500, while choosing R gives me (75 * 45 - number of times opponent chooses R) < $3375. Since I don't know the strategy of my opponent, it's reasonable to assume they will take advantage of my R choices. Therefore, I would choose B to maximize my overall earnings in this game.\n\nSo, my choice would be {B} as a human player."

By consistently choosing B, I can ensure a minimum payoff of 700$, as I get 35$ each time my opponent picks R (which would happen 20 times at most).

It might force my opponent to adapt their strategy, which could benefit me in the long run. But, it also carries the risk of losing money in this specific round.

Choosing B against an opponent who chooses R results in me receiving a lower payoff compared to when both players choose B.\n\nSince my opponent has chosen R in this round, it indicates that they may have found a strategy to exploit the pattern of us playing B against each other. In this case, it might be beneficial for me to switch strategies and try choosing R in the next round to see if I can earn more payoffs. However, I will need to carefully consider my opponent's possible responses before making any decisions.\n\nIn the next round, I will choose R as a response to my opponent's choice of R. This decision is based on the possibility that my opponent may have found a profitable strategy by deviating from their previous pattern of choosing B. However, I will need to monitor my opponent's responses closely to determine whether this strategy is effective for me in the long run."

Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If both of us always pick R (our best case scenario), we each earn 45$ per round for 75 rounds, which amounts to 3375$ in total.\n\n2. If I consistently pick R while the other player picks B, I would earn 0$ for 38 rounds and 35$ for the remaining 37 rounds, totaling 690$ (a net loss of 2685$). This seems highly unlikely as the other player might not consistently pick B.\n\n3. Similarly, if I always pick B while the other player picks R, I would earn 35$ for 38 rounds and 0$ for the remaining 37 rounds, totaling 1290$ (a net loss of 2085$). This also seems improbable given the game structure.\n\n4. If both of us pick B consistently, we each earn 40$ per round for 75 rounds, amounting to 3000$ in total. This is a better outcome compared to points 2 and 3 but still worse than picking R consistently (point 1). However, there is a chance that the other player might pick B more frequently if they realize that sticking with R leads to a disadvantageous payoff.\n\n5. To maximize our earnings, I would aim for a strategy that leans toward picking B while being flexible enough to switch to picking R if it seems beneficial. This strategy is based on the idea of exploiting the other player's potential inconsistencies and taking advantage of their possible mistakes or deviations from a strict B-strategy.\n\nGiven this line of reasoning, I would choose to pick B {B} in this game with an anonymous player."

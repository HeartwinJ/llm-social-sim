Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If my goal is to maximize my earnings over 75 rounds, I would choose a mixed strategy instead of consistently picking one option (R or B).\n\nOne possible mixed strategy could be to pick R about 60% of the time and pick B about 40% of the time. This way, when I pick R and my opponent picks B, I'll still earn something (20$ in this case), which is better than earning nothing if I consistently pick R.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the opponent is anonymous, so I have no information about their strategy. It could be that they are also using a mixed strategy, or they might be trying to exploit my choice by consistently picking the other option. This uncertainty makes the optimal strategy difficult to determine precisely.\n\nIn practice, I would likely choose R more frequently due to its higher potential payoff when the opponent picks B (45$ vs 40$). But overall, I would lean towards a mixed strategy to avoid being exploited and maximize my average earnings over the long run. {R} (with a slight bias towards R, but not always picking R)."

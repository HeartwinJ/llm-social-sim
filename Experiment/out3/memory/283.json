Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given the rules of the game, it seems like there's an advantage for choosing 'R' over 'B'. If both players choose 'R', they each earn 45$ per round, which is the maximum payoff. However, if one player chooses 'B' while the other chooses 'R', the 'R' player still earns more (40$) than if they had chosen 'B' (0$).\n\nThe strategy here seems to favor choosing 'R' consistently to maximize earnings, especially considering the number of rounds is 75. However, it's important to note that the game is with an anonymous player, so there's no way to predict their choice or adjust our strategy based on their past choices.\n\nIn a purely rational decision-making scenario, choosing 'R' seems to be the optimal move. But in reality, knowing the opponent's strategy could potentially influence the decision. Since I don't have that information, I will choose 'R' as my strategy for this game, but I understand that there's a small chance that the other player might consistently choose 'B', leading to lower earnings.\n\nSo, my choice is: R{}."

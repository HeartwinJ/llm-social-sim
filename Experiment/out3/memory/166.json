Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This approach can potentially confuse the other player and make it harder for them to predict my choice, thus increasing my chances of earning more than if I were to stick with one option only.\n\nIn practice, this could look like picking R around 50% of the time (e.g., R{R} or B{R}) and B around 50% of the time (e.g., R{B} or B{B}). However, since I am an undergraduate student participating in a lab experiment, it is possible that the game might have specific rules or restrictions that could influence my strategy decision.\n\nIn summary, I would choose R{R, B}, indicating that I will make a random choice between R and B for each round of the game."

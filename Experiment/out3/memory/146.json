Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In such games, it's often beneficial to not stick to one strategy consistently, but rather mix up your choices to confuse your opponent and maximize your earnings.\n\nHowever, given that the payoff for both choosing R when they choose B (40$) is higher than the payoff for both choosing B when they choose R (20$), it seems rational to lean towards choosing R more frequently.\n\nOn the other hand, if I consistently choose R, there's a risk that my opponent will exploit this pattern and choose B in every round where they expect me to choose R, thus earning 40$ in each of those rounds. This could result in significantly lower earnings over the course of the 75 rounds.\n\nTherefore, I would opt for a mixed strategy, occasionally choosing R and B in an effort to make it harder for my opponent to predict my choice. The exact proportion of R and B choices might depend on the specific assumptions about my opponent's behavior. But remember, this is just one possible approach to the problem, and other strategies could potentially yield different outcomes. I choose R{R}.\n\nThis reasoning assumes that my goal is to maximize my total earnings over the 75 rounds, but if the experiment has additional rules or incentives, or if you have additional information about your opponent, your strategy might differ."

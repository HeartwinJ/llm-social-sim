Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This happens in half of the games (37.5 times on average due to 75 rounds). So, for choosing R, the total payoff would be $37.5 * 45 + 0 * (75 - 37.5) = $1687.5.\n\nIf I always pick B, I will get 20$ in each game when they also pick B, and 40$ when they pick R. This happens 37.5 times on average when they pick R (75 / 2 = 37.5 rounds) and 37.5 times on average when they pick B (since it's the same player, we can consider it as one round for each player's choice). So, for choosing B, the total payoff would be $37.5 * 40 + 20 * (75 - 37.5) = $1812.5.\n\nSince the expected payoff is higher when I pick B, it would make sense for me to choose B for a higher average payoff over the 75 rounds.\n\nSo my choice would be {B} as a human player."

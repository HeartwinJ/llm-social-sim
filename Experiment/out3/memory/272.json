Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe game is repeated 75 times, which means that there will be multiple instances where both players pick R (45$ each), B-R (0$ for me and 40$ for them) or B-B (20$ each). To maximize my earnings, I want to minimize the number of times I choose B.\n\nSince my opponent might also be trying to maximize their earnings, it's likely that they will also try to minimize the number of times they pick B. Therefore, if we both adopt the strategy of picking R most of the time, there will be more instances where we both pick R (45$ each) and fewer instances where I pick B while they pick R (0$ for me).\n\nHowever, it's also important to account for the times when we both pick B (20$ each), as this will inevitably happen in some rounds. To minimize these instances, I would want to pick B as little as possible, but not too little, since picking R all the time would lead to many opportunities where they pick R while I pick B (0$ for me).\n\nConsidering both factors, the strategy of picking R most of the time seems to offer the best payoff, as it maximizes the number of instances where we both pick R and minimizes the number of instances where I pick B while they pick R. So, I choose strategy R{R}."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In that case, I would lose out on potential earnings in each round we play R versus B.\n\nHowever, by adopting a mixed strategy, I can ensure that there's a probability of choosing both R and B over the 75 rounds. This means that if my opponent is also using a mixed strategy, we will both pick R and B at some point during the game, maximizing our earnings in those instances.\n\nIn terms of specific probabilities for each choice (R or B), it's important to consider that R is the dominant strategy when played against B since it provides a higher payoff in both scenarios (RR vs RB). Therefore, I should assign a higher probability to choosing R than B. A possible ratio could be 2:1, with a probability of 2/3 for R and 1/3 for B.\n\nAs a human player, I would choose R {R} in the first round while keeping in mind that my strategy involves a mix of both choices throughout the game. This approach allows me to maximize potential earnings while minimizing the risk of consistently playing against my opponent's dominant choice (B)."

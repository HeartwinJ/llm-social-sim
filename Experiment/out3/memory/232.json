Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Here's how I reason:\n\n- If I pick R, and they pick B, I get 0$ once for every time they pick B, which is 25 times (since there are 75 rounds in total, and they earn 35$ when I pick R). However, if I pick R and they also pick R, we both get 45$, which happens 50 times on average (since the game is symmetric). So, my expected payoff for picking R is 25*0 + 50*45 = $2250.\n- If I pick B, and they pick R, I get 35$ once for every time they pick R, which is 25 times. However, if I pick B and they also pick B, we both get 40$, which happens 50 times on average. So, my expected payoff for picking B is 25*35 + 50*40 = $2600.\n\nThe expected value of picking R ($2250) is less than the expected value of picking B ($2600). Therefore, as a human player, I would choose B (B{}). This decision assumes that the anonymous player also chooses optimally and follows the rules of the game."

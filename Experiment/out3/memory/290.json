Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

The potential gain of 3$ (45$-42$) from a round where I pick R and they pick B is not significant enough to compensate for the possible losses I may incur if we both pick R or B multiple times over the course of the 75 rounds.

In this game, there are two dominant strategies: R and B.\n\nIf both players consistently choose the same strategy (either R or B), then they will end up with the same payoff after each round. However, since the other player is anonymous, I don't know their choice in advance. Therefore, it seems more prudent to choose a strategy that provides a higher average payout when playing against either strategy.\n\nLet's calculate the expected value for both choices:\n\n1. If I choose R and my opponent chooses B, I get 0$ once. But if they also choose R, we both get 45$ in that round. Since there are 75 rounds and I don't know their choice in advance, I expect to face an opponent choosing R around half of the time (37.5 times). So my expected payoff in these cases would be:\n\n   0 * (1/2) + 45 * (1/2) = 22.5$\n\n2. If I choose B and my opponent chooses R, I get 40$ once. But if they also choose B, we both get 20$ in that round.

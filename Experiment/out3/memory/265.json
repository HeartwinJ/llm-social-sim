Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason is that in the long run, picking R consistently has a higher expected payoff compared to picking B consistently.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. In any round, if both players pick R, each gets 45$. This is the most favorable outcome for both players.\n2. If I choose R while the opponent chooses B, I get 0$ and they get 40$. However, since this happens only once for every two times we differ in our choices (assuming a fair player), the net loss from these rounds is minimal.\n3. Similarly, if I pick B while my opponent picks R, I get 40$, and they get 0$. Again, this happens only once for every two times we differ in our choices.\n4. If both players pick B, each gets 20$ in that round. Since the payoff from picking R is higher (45$) than picking B (20$), it makes sense to aim for a higher payoff in as many rounds as possible.\n5. In the long run, if my opponent is also rational and follows a similar strategy, we will end up with a mix of outcomes, but since I prefer R over B due to its higher payoff, consistently picking R gives me a better chance at a higher average payoff over 75 rounds.\n\nTherefore, I would choose strategy R{R} for this game."

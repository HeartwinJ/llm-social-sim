Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In such situations, it's common to choose the strategy that guarantees the highest average payoff when both players use mixed strategies.\n\nIn this case, if we always pick R (or B), our minimum payoff is 0$, which happens when our opponent picks B (or R). On the other hand, if we use a random strategy and pick R or B with equal probability, our average payoff per round would be:\n\n- When picking R: (45$*P(opponent picks R) + 0$*P(opponent picks B)) / 2 = 27.5$ (since P(opponent picks R) + P(opponent picks B) = 1 and they are equally likely to pick either)\n- When picking B: (42$*P(opponent picks R) + 12$*P(opponent picks B)) / 2 = 26.5$\n\nSince the average payoff is higher when we pick R, I would choose R as my strategy, appending it with curly braces in the last character: {R}"

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If we both consistently choose R, we will earn 45$ every round, but if we deviate and choose B even once, the other player can take advantage of that and get 42$ while we get 0$.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing B all the time gives us a steady 12$ per round, but it allows the opponent to earn 45$ whenever they switch to R. However, if the opponent switches back to B after earning 45$, we would again be earning 12$.\n\nGiven that the game has 75 rounds and we can't predict our opponent's behavior perfectly, it seems prudent to avoid taking a significant payoff hit for a single deviation. Therefore, I would opt for a strategy that guarantees us a steady stream of smaller rewards over time rather than risking large losses in the pursuit of greater gains.\n\nIn this case, I would choose B (curly brackets: {B}) as my strategy, knowing that there is always a chance that my opponent will also choose B, allowing me to earn 12$ per round while minimizing the potential for large losses due to deviations from the chosen strategy."

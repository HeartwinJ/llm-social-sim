Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In each round, there are two possible outcomes: either both players choose R (RR), or one chooses R and the other B (RB or BR).\n\nThe payoff matrix for the game is as follows:\n\n|     | R  | B  |\n|---|---| ---|\n| R  | 45, 45   |  0, 42   |\n| B  | 42, 0    | 12, 12  |\n\nWhen playing against a rational opponent, we can see that there's no strictly dominant strategy in this game. However, if we analyze the expected payoffs for both strategies, we can make an informed choice.\n\nExpected Payoff for R:\n(0 * P(opponent chooses B) + 45 * P(opponent chooses R)) / 2\n= (0 * 1/2 + 45 * 1/2) / 2\n= 22.5\n\nExpected Payoff for B:\n(42 * P(opponent chooses R) + 12 * P(opponent chooses B)) / 2\n= (42 * 1/2 + 12 * 1/2) / 2\n= 21.5\n\nSince the expected payoff for choosing R is slightly higher than that of choosing B, I would choose to play R {R}.

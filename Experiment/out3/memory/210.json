Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Since we have 75 rounds, there's a higher probability of having more \"R-R\" or \"B-B\" pairs if I consistently pick one strategy (either R or B).\n\nTo maximize my earnings in the long run, I would choose R because it has a higher payoff in the best-case scenario, and I'm more likely to have more opportunities to receive that higher payoff due to the larger number of rounds.

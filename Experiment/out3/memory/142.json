Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In each round, choosing B earns me 12$ if the opponent chooses B too, or 42$ if they choose R. This means that I have a better outcome in the event that the opponent chooses R (which happens when I choose B).\n\n2. Since the game is anonymous and has 75 rounds, it's not possible to adjust my strategy based on the opponent's past choices. Therefore, assuming there is no strategic reasoning or pattern behind the opponent's choice, I would have a higher average payoff over the long term by choosing B.\n\n3. The worst-case scenario (if the opponent consistently chooses R) results in an average payoff of 12$ per round for me as a B player, while the average payoff for an R player in this worst-case scenario would be 0$. Since the goal is to maximize my own payoff over the long term, I will choose strategy B.\n\n4. However, it's important to note that if the opponent is rational and also chooses B based on the same reasoning, then we both end up with an average payoff of 12$ per round. In this case, there exists a Nash equilibrium for the game where both players choose B."

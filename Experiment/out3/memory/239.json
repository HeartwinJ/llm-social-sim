Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Always pick R (R{}) - In this case, if the anonymous player also chooses R, we both earn $45 each round, for a total of $3,375 ($45*75) over 75 rounds. If the anonymous player picks B every time, however, we get nothing in those rounds, earning a total of $0 for the game. The average payoff would be approximately $1687.5 ($3,375 + 0)/2.\n\n2. Always pick B (B{}) - In this case, if the anonymous player also chooses B every round, we both earn $20 each round, for a total of $1,500 ($20*75) over 75 rounds. If the anonymous player picks R every time, we get $40 in those rounds, earning a total of $3,000 ($40*75) for the game. The average payoff would be approximately $2,250 ($1,500 + $3,000)/2.\n\nGiven that the strategy B{} results in an average payoff of $2,250 compared to $1,687.5 for R{}, I would choose B{}. While there's a higher variance in the outcome if the anonymous player chooses R every round, the potential for earning more ($3,000) outweighs the possibility of earning less (no payout)."

However, if my opponent is likely to choose R again, it may be beneficial to switch to a different strategy in order to avoid giving them an advantage.\n\nIt is also important to keep track of the payouts and my opponent's behavior, as well as their past moves, in order to make informed decisions in the following rounds.

It is still important to remain vigilant and keep track of our opponent's behavior, as well as their past moves, in order to make informed decisions in the following rounds.\n\nIt is also worth considering the possibility of mixing up our strategies or introducing new strategies into the game in order to keep our opponents guessing and to increase our chances of winning.

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Choosing R: In this case, if my opponent chooses R too, we both earn 45$. However, if they choose B, I get 0$. Since there are 75 rounds, it is likely that my opponent will not always choose R, so I might lose some rounds when choosing R.\n\n2. Choosing B: If my opponent chooses B too, we both earn 20$. However, if they choose R, I get 40$, which is more than the 0$ I would get by choosing R and having them choose B.\n\nGiven that this is a repeated game, I would likely lean towards choosing B more often. This strategy, known as tit-for-tat, assumes my opponent will respond in kind if I reciprocate their actions. By doing so, I can maximize my long-term payoff by ensuring I don't lose too many rounds where I get 0$. Choosing B {B} would be my strategy for this game."

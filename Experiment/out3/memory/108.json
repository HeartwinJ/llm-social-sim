Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, if they pick B while I pick R, I get nothing. So, there is a risk of getting zero if they deviate from picking R.\n- If I pick B, and they also pick B, I get 20$. But if they pick R while I pick B, I still get 40$, which is more than the 45$ I would get if we both picked R and they deviated to B in a single round. So, there is a safer route to a higher average payoff by picking B.\n\nGiven that this game has 75 rounds, I would expect that my opponent may also consider maximizing their total earnings and realize that picking B is the safer strategy. Therefore, I would choose B as my strategy since it offers a higher average payoff and less risk of getting zero in any round (which could significantly impact the overall earnings over 75 rounds). {B}"

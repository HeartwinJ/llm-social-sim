Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, in all the other rounds where they pick B, I get 0$. Since there are more B choices (68 out of 75), I would end up with less than 45$ for most of the rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, if I pick B consistently, then in each round where they pick R, I still get 35$, which is not bad. And in the majority of rounds (68 out of 75) when they also pick B, I get 40$. This strategy would provide a more stable and higher average payoff.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, my choice would be B{B}."

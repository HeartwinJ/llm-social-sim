Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The game is symmetric - it doesn't matter if I make the first move or not because both players have the same options and payoffs.\n2. In every round, there are four possible outcomes (both R, me R and them B, me B and them R, both B). However, if I only care about maximizing my total earnings in 75 rounds, two of these outcomes are irrelevant because they give the same total for both players (Both R and Both B).\n3. So, effectively, there are only two strategies to consider: picking R every time, or picking B every time.\n4. If I pick R every time, I would earn 0$ in each round where my opponent picks B (which happens 25 times on average), and 45$ in the remaining rounds. This results in a total of (75 - 25) * 45 + 25 * 0 = 2700$.\n5. If I pick B every time, I would earn 0$ in each round where my opponent picks R (which happens 25 times on average), and 20$ in the remaining rounds. This results in a total of (75 - 25) * 20 + 25 * 40 = 1600 + 1000 = 2600$.\n6. Choosing B every time gives me a higher total payoff, so I would choose B{B}."

This means that when my opponent chooses R, it is advantageous for me to choose B as well (since I earn 40$ and my opponent receives 0$). However, if my opponent chooses B, I should choose R to maximize my payoff (since I only receive 0$ if we both pick R).\n3. Since I don't know what my opponent will do in the future, I cannot predict with certainty whether choosing R or B will be more beneficial for me in the long run.\n4. However, if I assume that my opponent is rational and seeks to maximize their own payoff as well, they would have chosen B in this round because it gave them a higher payoff (40$ vs 0$).\n5. If my opponent is indeed rational, they will also recognize that choosing R when I choose B results in a higher payoff for them (40$ vs 0$). This suggests that it might be beneficial for me to switch strategies from B to R to confuse my opponent and potentially take advantage of this behavior.\n6. However, if my opponent is indeed rational and anticipates that I might try to exploit their apparent strategy of choosing R when I choose B, they may choose B again in the future rounds to avoid falling into a predictable pattern.\n7.

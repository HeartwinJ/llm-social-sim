However, if both players choose R simultaneously, we both get 45$. Since the opponent is anonymous and I cannot predict their choices accurately, it would be risky to rely on the higher payoff from choosing R when they pick B.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing B ensures that I will earn at least 20$ in each round where my opponent chooses R, and if both of us choose B, we'll still earn a guaranteed 20$. Since the game has 75 rounds, it is more likely to have at least one opponent who picks B frequently enough for me to benefit from choosing B myself.\n\nTherefore, as a human player, I would opt to pick 'B' to minimize risk and maximize earnings in the long run (over the 75 rounds). {B}"

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In each round, there are four possible outcomes based on both players' choices (RR, RB, BR, BB).\n\n2. For any given round, the optimal choice for the opponent (assuming they are also rational) is to maximize their payoff, which means picking B if I pick R and vice versa. This means that for each round where I choose R, the probability of getting 0$ is 50%, while the probability of getting 45$ is also 50%. Similarly, if I choose B in a given round, there's a 50% chance of getting 35$ and a 50% chance of getting 40$.\n\n3. However, because there are 75 rounds, the average payoff over time favors the strategy that leads to a higher expected value per round. In this case, the difference between the expected values for R and B is (0.5*0 + 0.5*45 - 0.5*35 - 0.5*40) = 2.5$.\n\n4. Since a higher expected payoff per round favors strategy R, I would choose R{R} as my strategy for the game."

However, if I switch my strategy to B, the opponent's optimal response would be to switch to R.

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

If I play R:\n   - If the opponent plays R, I get 45$ (once). This happens with a probability of (1/2)^75 since the opponent is assumed to make a random choice.\n   - If the opponent plays B, I get 0$. This happens with a probability of (1/2)^75 as well.\n   - The expected value for choosing R would be: (45 * (1/2)^75) + (0 * (1/2)^75) = approximately 0.0359 cents after 75 rounds.\n\n2. If I play B:\n   - If the opponent plays R, I get 42$. This happens with a probability of (1/2)^75.\n   - If the opponent plays B, I get 12$. This happens with a probability of (1/2)^75 as well.\n   - The expected value for choosing B would be: (42 * (1/2)^75) + (12 * (1/2)^75) = approximately 0.1936 cents after 75 rounds.\n\nGiven these calculations, it seems that the expected value of choosing 'B' is higher than that of choosing 'R'. However, since the differences are quite small due to compounded probabilities over 75 rounds and the fact that we're dealing with cents, a rational human player might choose either option based on their personal risk tolerance or other factors.\n\nIn this case, I would still choose B (as in 'B{'}') since it appears to have a slightly higher expected value, but I understand that there are other considerations at play in real-world scenarios."

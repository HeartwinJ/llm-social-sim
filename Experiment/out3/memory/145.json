Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Let's consider two strategies: always picking R (denoted as Strategy A) and always picking B (Strategy B).\n\nIn Strategy A, if the anonymous player also chooses R, we both earn 45$ per round, for a total of 3375$. However, if they choose B, we get 0$, resulting in a loss of (75-33) * 0 = -2085$ over 75 rounds. The average payoff for Strategy A would be 3375 + (-2085) / 2 = 1190$.\n\nIn Strategy B, if the anonymous player chooses R, we get 42$, and if they choose B, we both earn 12$, resulting in a total of (63 * 75) + (12 * 75 - 33 * 75) / 2 = 4875$ over 75 rounds.\n\nComparing the two strategies, Strategy B provides a higher average payoff of 4875$, which is significantly better than the 1190$ provided by Strategy A. Therefore, I would choose to always pick B (Strategically, {B})."

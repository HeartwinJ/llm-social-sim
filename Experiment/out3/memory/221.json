Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Let's calculate the expected payoff for each choice (R or B) based on the probabilities of the opponent's response.\n\nIf I play R, and assuming that my opponent plays R and B with equal probability (0.5), my expected payoff is: 0.5*45 + 0.5*0 = 22.5$.\n\nIf I play B, and again assuming that my opponent plays R and B with equal probability (0.5), my expected payoff is: 0.5*40 + 0.5*35 = 37.5$.\n\nGiven these calculations, it seems that playing B gives a higher expected payoff over the long term. However, this assumption about the opponent's strategy may not always hold true as they might have a rational strategy of their own.

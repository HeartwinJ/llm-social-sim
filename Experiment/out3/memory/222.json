Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, the payoff for choosing B when the other player chooses R (35$) is slightly higher than the payoff for choosing R when the other player chooses B (0$ or 35$, respectively). Since the game has 75 rounds, I would expect a slight advantage from consistently choosing B over R in this scenario. This reasoning assumes that my opponent will not be able to adapt their strategy based on my choices, but it could change if they do."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Even though the immediate payoff for choosing R is higher (45$) when my opponent chooses B, over the long run, the consistent 12$ payout per round from choosing B becomes more attractive.\n\n2. The difference in the initial payoff between R and B is not significant enough to warrant a risky strategy that could lead to repeated losses if my opponent catches on to my pattern and consistently chooses R when I do.\n\n3. Since my opponent is anonymous, I have no way of knowing their strategy. By choosing a consistent strategy (B), I can maximize the average payout while minimizing potential losses due to miscalculating my opponent's strategy.\n\n4. In this game, there seems to be a slight advantage for the opponent if they choose R consistently and I don't catch on. If I choose R, I would have to guess their pattern and switch to B when appropriate to minimize losses. However, by choosing B consistently, I can maintain a higher average payout without having to guess my opponent's strategy."

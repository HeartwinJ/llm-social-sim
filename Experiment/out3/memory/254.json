Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Let's calculate the expected value for both choices:\n\n- Choice R: In each round where my opponent picks R (42$ for me), I lose nothing (0$). However, in each round where my opponent picks B (45$ for me), I get 45$. So, when multiplying the possible outcomes by their probabilities and averaging them out, I expect to earn:\n\n  Expected value of R = ((75 - x) * 0 + x * 42) / 75\n\n  Where x is the number of rounds where my opponent picks R. Since my opponent is also making this choice simultaneously and independently, the probability that they pick R in any given round is also 1/2. So, x should be approximately 37.5, but since we can't have half a round, let's assume either 38 or 37 rounds where my opponent picks R (since I don't know their exact choice).\n\n   Expected value of R \u2248 ((37 * 0) + (38 * 42)) / 75 = $16.13 per round on average\n\n- Choice B: In each round where my opponent picks R, I get 42$, and in each round where they pick B, I earn 12$. So, the expected value of choosing B is:\n\n  Expected value of B = ((75 - x) * 42 + x * 12) / 75\n\n   Expected value of B \u2248 ((37 * 42) + (38 * 12)) / 75 = $21.60 per round on average\n\nGiven that the expected value of choosing B is higher than that of choosing R, I would choose to play B in this game, as it offers a higher average payoff for each round. So, my choice would be {B}."

In this specific scenario, it might seem like choosing R could potentially yield a higher payoff (since I would get 45$ if my opponent picks R), but given that I don't know whether they will switch their strategy or continue with B, and considering the long-term expected values, I still believe that choosing B is the better option for me.

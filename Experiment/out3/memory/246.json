Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In such games, it's often beneficial for both players to not have a fixed strategy but to mix their choices randomly.\n\nHowever, since the payoff difference between R and B when both players choose differently (35$ vs. 0$) is significant, there might be an incentive to deviate from pure randomness. I would consider favoring R slightly more than B in my mixed strategy, as the potential for a larger payoff if the anonymous player chooses B could lead to higher earnings over time.\n\nBut since this is a one-time decision, without knowing the specific strategies of the anonymous player or any additional information about the game, it's difficult to make a definitive choice. In such cases, some players might choose R ({R}), while others might choose B ({B}). It ultimately depends on the individual's risk tolerance and personal strategies."

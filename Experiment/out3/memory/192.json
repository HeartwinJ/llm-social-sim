Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Let's consider two strategies: Always choosing R (strategy A) and always choosing B (strategy B).\n\n1. Strategy A (Always R): If the opponent also chooses R, we both earn 45$ each round. But since there are 75 rounds, in the worst-case scenario (both choose R every time), our total earnings would be 3375$ for me and 3375$ for the opponent.\n\n2. Strategy B (Always B): If the opponent chooses R, I get 42$ and they get 0$. But if they also choose B, we both earn 12$ each round. Over 75 rounds, in the best-case scenario (both choose B every time), my total earnings would be 900$ and the opponent's 900$ too.\n\nSince Strategy A guarantees a higher worst-case outcome (3375$) compared to Strategy B's best-case outcome (900$), I would choose strategy A and append my choice as {R}. However, it's important to note that the actual outcome may vary depending on the opponent's strategy. In practice, some players might adjust their strategies based on previous results in a process called learning or adaptation."

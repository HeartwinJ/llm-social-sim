Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Here's the payoff matrix for this game:\n\n|      | R (You)     | B (Anon)    |\n|---|---|---|\n| R (You) | 45, 45   |  0, 42    |\n| B (You)   | 42, 0    |  12, 12   |\n\nIn this game, picking the same option (R or B) results in a higher payoff than choosing differently. Since both R and B have unique advantages, it is hard to determine which option is strictly superior, making the game a mixed-strategy game.\n\nHowever, as we're playing the game for 75 rounds, I would consider my choice strategically. Here are two strategies:\n\n1. Stick with one choice (R or B) throughout the entire game. If you choose R, you will earn 0$ in 25 rounds and 45$ in 50 rounds, totaling $900. If you stick with B, you will earn $360 in all 75 rounds.\n2. Mix up your choices using a specific probability (e.g., pick R with a probability of 0.8 and B with a probability of 0.2). This way, you might earn more than the static choice strategy over the long run due to the higher payoffs when both players choose the same option.\n\nIn this scenario, I would consider using a mixed strategy with a slight preference for R (e.g., pick R with a probability of 0.8 and B with a probability of 0.2). This way, I could potentially earn more than my opponent in the long run while still leaving room for adjustments based on how they play over time.\n\nMy choice would be R ({R}). However, I would continuously monitor my opponent's choices to adapt my strategy as needed and maximize my total earnings throughout the 75 rounds."

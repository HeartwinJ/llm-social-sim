Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, if we play the game multiple times, there's a chance that our combined earnings will even out over time, considering we both get 20$ when choosing B together, and 45$ when choosing R together.\n\nGiven that the game has 75 rounds, I believe it's important to consider the long-term strategy here. If I choose R in every round, my total earnings would be $3150 (since I get 0$ for any R-B pairings and 45$ for all R-R pairings). On the other hand, if I choose B in every round, my total earnings would be $1500 (since I get 20$ for all B-B pairings).\n\nHowever, it's not guaranteed that my opponent will always choose B when I choose R. If there's a chance they also switch strategies midway, I might benefit more by choosing R and getting the higher payoff in case of a match (45$) rather than settling for the lower payoff with B (20$).\n\nIn this scenario, given that we don't have information about our opponent's strategy and the game has a large number of rounds, I would choose R as it offers a higher potential payoff in case of a match.

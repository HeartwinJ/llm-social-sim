Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Let's calculate the expected payoff for both options:\n\n1) Picking 'R':\n- If the opponent also picks 'R', we get 45$ (once every time they pick R, which is 25 times in 75 rounds since both players pick R half of the time).\n- If the opponent picks 'B', we get 0$ (37.5 times out of 75, since they pick B more often).\n\nSo, expected payoff for 'R' = ((25 * 45) + (37.5 * 0)) / 75 = 9.625$.\n\n2) Picking 'B':\n- If the opponent also picks 'B', we get 40$ (30 times out of 75, since both players pick B a fourth of the time).\n- If the opponent picks 'R', we get 35$ (40 times out of 75, since they pick R three fourths of the time).\n\nSo, expected payoff for 'B' = ((30 * 40) + (40 * 35)) / 75 = 12$.\n\nSince picking 'B' gives a higher expected payoff than picking 'R', I would choose to pick 'B' in this game. {B}"

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Here is the payoff table for reference:\n\n|       | R  | B  |\n|---|---| ---|\n| R    | 45, 45 | 0, 35 |\n| B    | 35, 0   | 40, 40 |\n\nIn this game, the payoff is not symmetric for both players when they pick different strategies. When I choose R and my opponent chooses B, I get 0$ while they get 35$. This outcome is not ideal for me. However, when I choose B while they choose R, I receive 35$, which is better than getting nothing.\n\nOn the other hand, if we both pick B in a round, we each earn 40$. Comparing this to the payoffs when we pick different strategies, it seems that choosing B with my opponent offers a higher average payoff (40$) compared to choosing R and having them choose B or vice versa (0$ for me).\n\nNow, let's consider the number of rounds. The game has 75 rounds in total. As I have already mentioned, there is a higher average payoff when both players pick B. Since we are playing the game multiple times, it seems logical to choose B as my strategy, maximizing my chances of earning 40$ per round (on average). So, I would choose {B} as my strategy for this experiment."

This means that you received no payoff, while your opponent earned a payoff of 35$.\n\nNow, let's consider the game dynamics: Since your opponent has chosen B in this round, they have indicated that they may switch back to choosing R in future rounds. In this case, it would be beneficial for you to switch your strategy from R to B and continue choosing B as long as your opponent continues to choose R.\n\nIn summary, the optimal strategy for you in this game would be to switch your strategy from R to B and continue choosing B as long as your opponent continues to choose R. This would maximize your potential payoffs given that your opponent has shown a consistent preference for choosing B when you choose R. However, keep an eye on their behavior and adjust your strategy accordingly if necessary."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, since both choices do not offer equal payoffs when played against each other (R yields 45$ while B yields 42$), it suggests that there might be an incentive to deviate from the pure strategy of always choosing the same option.\n\nIn this case, with 75 rounds, I would tend to favor a mixed strategy approach, where I randomly pick R and B in each round, ensuring that my choices are unpredictable over the long run. This way, if the other player adopts a similar mixed strategy, we both can expect an average payoff of (0.5 * 42$) + (0.5 * 12$) = 26$ per round.\n\nHowever, if I believe that my opponent might exploit me by consistently choosing R when I play B and vice versa, I could also adopt a more aggressive mixed strategy where I choose R more frequently than B in the initial rounds to capitalize on their potential exploitation and earn higher payoffs early on.\n\nIn conclusion, as a human player, my choice would be {R or B}, depending on whether I adopt a cautious mixed strategy or an aggressive mixed strategy with a slight bias towards R in the initial rounds."

Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

On the other hand, if we both pick R in every round, I would earn 45$ per round, totaling to 3375$. So, by picking R, I could potentially earn 3375$, but the worst-case scenario is that I earn nothing.\n\nIf I always pick B (denoted as {B}), and my opponent always picks R, then I get 42$ for each of the 75 rounds, totaling to 1890$. If we both pick B in every round, I would earn 12$ per round, totaling to 900$. So, by picking B, I could potentially earn 1890$, but the worst-case scenario is that I earn 900$.\n\nIt seems that picking R gives a higher potential payoff than picking B. However, since my opponent is anonymous and their choice may not follow any predictable pattern, it's also possible that they could exploit my decision to pick R consistently by always picking B, leaving me with 0$ in each round while they earn 1890$.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, I might choose a mixed strategy where I occasionally pick B as well. However, the optimal mixed strategy would require careful calculations and knowledge of the opponent's potential moves, which is not provided in this scenario. Therefore, without further information, it's difficult to definitively say what my choice should be.\n\nIn practice, I might choose {R} because it offers a higher potential payoff, but I would remain aware that the actual outcome could differ significantly based on my opponent's behavior."

In a finite-horizon setting, it is important to capitalize on opportunities for higher payoffs while still maintaining a consistent strategy to minimize risk and maximize long-term earnings.\n\nGiven that the game is still ongoing, I should analyze my opponent's strategy and decide whether to continue picking B consistently or switch back to picking R periodically to take advantage of potential opportunities for higher payoffs while minimizing losses when they are not available. One possible approach could be to alternate between R and B for several rounds to see if either strategy provides a higher average payoff over time while still capitalizing on high payoffs when they are available and minimizing losses when they are not.\n\nIf we were to continue playing, I would analyze each round's outcome and adjust my strategy accordingly based on observed patterns in my opponent's choices. It is important to remain adaptable and flexible throughout the game to maximize earnings in a finite-horizon setting.\n\nIn the next round, I choose {R} as a deviation from my recent B choice to see if picking R instead of B could potentially provide a higher average payoff over time while still taking into account the potential for high payoffs when they are available and minimizing losses when they are not. If we were to continue playing, I would analyze each round's outcome and adjust my strategy accordingly based on observed patterns in my opponent's choices.\n\nIn the next round, I choose {R}."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Let's calculate the expected payoff for both choices:\n\n1) If I choose R:\n- If opponent chooses R, we both earn 45$ (once every round)\n- If opponent chooses B, I earn 0$ (35 times), and 35$ (37 times). Total earnings are 37*35 - 35*0 = $1265.\n\n2) If I choose B:\n- If opponent chooses R, I earn 35$ (35 times), and 0$ (40 times). Total earnings are 35*35 - 40*0 = $1225.\n- If opponent chooses B, we both earn 40$ (once every round)\n\nSince I get a higher expected payoff when choosing R compared to choosing B, my choice would be {R}. However, it is essential to note that the outcome might differ if my opponent also strategizes or acts randomly."

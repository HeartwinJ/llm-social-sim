You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' results in a loss if the opponent chooses 'B', while choosing 'B' only results in a lower payout if the opponent also chooses 'B'.\n\nHowever, since both choices have the potential to result in losses (albeit different amounts), I would lean towards the choice that offers a higher return when my opponent makes the same choice as me. In this case, choosing 'R' will result in a greater payout (45$) compared to choosing 'B' (12$).\n\nI'm also considering the long-term implications of this game spanning 75 rounds. The more times I choose 'R', the higher my potential winnings (up to 3750$ if the opponent always chooses 'B'). However, if the opponent anticipates this strategy and adjusts their choices accordingly, they could potentially manipulate the game to their advantage.\n\nGiven these factors, I'll go with 'R' as my choice, but I would be prepared to adapt my strategy based on the opponent's behavior during the game. {R}"

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given my cautious nature, I would prefer to minimize the risk of getting 0$ and maximize the potential for the higher payoff of 45$. However, since this is a repeated game with an unknown opponent, it's hard to predict their strategy over 75 rounds.\n\nOne common strategy in games like this is to consider the expected value (EV) of each choice. The EV is the average payoff you can expect from each decision, taking into account all possible outcomes and their probabilities. In this case, the EV for R can be calculated as follows:\n\n- If my opponent also picks R, I get 45$ once out of every four rounds (25/75 = 0.333...). This gives me an expected payoff of 0.333 * 45 = 14.92$.\n- If my opponent picks B, I get 0$ half the time (37.5/75 = 0.5) and 42$ the other half (37.5/75 = 0.5). This gives me an expected payoff of 0.5 * 0 + 0.5 * 42 = 21$.\n\nSimilarly, the EV for B is:\n\n- If my opponent also picks B, I get 12$ every 9 rounds (9/75 = 0.12). This gives me an expected payoff of 0.12 * 12 = 1.44$.\n- If my opponent picks R, I get 0$ half the time (37.5/75 = 0.5) and 42$ the other half (37.5/75 = 0.5). This gives me an expected payoff of 0.5 * 42 + 0.5 * 0 = 21$.\n\nIn both cases, the EV for B is higher than that for R. However, it's important to consider that this calculation assumes my opponent will play optimally and make rational decisions. In reality, an opponent might not always do so, especially in repeated games where they may deviate from optimal strategy due to factors like impatience or confusion about the other player's intentions.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I would likely choose B as my main strategy but occasionally switch to R to exploit any potential inconsistencies or irrationality in my opponent's play. My final choice would be {B}."

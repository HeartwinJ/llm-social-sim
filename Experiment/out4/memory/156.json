You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing either R or B consistently will result in a steady income but with potential losses if the opponent chooses the opposite.\n\nThe optimal strategy here is to use a mixed strategy, where I randomly select R and B each with some probability greater than 0 and less than 1. This way, I can avoid being predictable and maximize my chances of winning both the 45$ payout (when opponent chooses R) and the 12$ payout (when opponent chooses B).\n\nHowever, since this is an undergraduate lab experiment, it's possible that the opponent will also choose a mixed strategy. In such a case, choosing either R or B consistently might still lead to a positive outcome if the opponent's strategy happens to be similar to mine.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would pick R as my initial choice and randomly switch between R and B throughout the 75 rounds of the game, while maintaining a slight bias towards the more favorable option (R) due to my preference for security and predictability.\n\n{R}"

        "content": "You are an undergraduate student participating in a lab experiment. You have a balanced approach to risk. You are willing to take risks occasionally, but you also value security and caution in equal measure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my balanced approach to risk, I would opt for strategy that maximizes both security and potential gain. In this game, if we both choose R, we get 45$ each round. However, if we have a tendency to pick the same choice, it might be beneficial to switch strategies occasionally to avoid always losing when our opponent chooses differently.\n\nIn 75 rounds, the best-case scenario (both choosing R) will yield 3375$, and the worst-case scenario (always picking opposite choices) will result in earning 2250$. Meanwhile, if we stick with one choice for all 75 rounds (either R or B), we would end up with either 3150$ or 3450$ depending on our initial pick.\n\nBy alternating strategies, there is a chance that we can increase the likelihood of landing in the best-case scenario while minimizing losses. As I am risk-averse yet willing to take calculated risks, I will choose R_{for this round} and see how the game progresses from there. This way, I maintain the security of earning at least 40$ per round if my opponent sticks with their initial choice or decide to alternate as well."

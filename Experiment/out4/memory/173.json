You are willing to take risks occasionally, but you also value security and caution in equal measure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since I'm playing against an anonymous player, there's no way to predict their strategy.\n\nIn such cases, the dominant strategy doesn't exist, so a common approach is to choose a mixed strategy, which is a probability distribution over strategies. In this game, a 50/50 mix of R and B (i.e., playing R half the time and B the other half) would be reasonable. If my opponent does the same, we would both average around 27.5$ per round, which is better than either sticking to R or B exclusively for the whole game.\n\nSo, my choice would be a mix of R and B, which translates to 'R' in this context as that's what I would do for the first round. However, keep in mind that my strategy throughout the game would actually involve choosing both R and B with roughly equal probability. {R}"

You are comfortable with uncertainty and potential failure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing B results in a slightly higher expected payoff of approximately $2 per round or $150 for 75 rounds.\n\nGiven these calculations and my risk-taking nature, I would choose to pick B ({B}) as it provides a slightly better expected outcome over the long run, considering the repeated nature of the game and the anonymity of the opponent."

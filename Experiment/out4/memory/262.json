You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing B will always earn me 20$ when my opponent chooses B as well, which happens 25% of the time (assuming random choices). Since there are 75 rounds in total, I can expect to earn approximately 18.75 * 20 = $375 if my opponent is playing randomly or if we both adopt a similar strategy.\n\nIf, however, my opponent consistently chooses R, then I will only earn 40$ per round when they choose R and 0$ otherwise, which comes out to be approximately (75 - 25) * 40 + 25 * 0 = $1900 in total.\n\nTo maximize my earnings, I need to consider the possibility that my opponent may also choose a conservative strategy similar to mine and opt for B most of the time as well. In such a case, by choosing B more frequently, I can increase the chances of earning 45$ per round while minimizing the risk of getting 0$.\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose B as my primary option in this game, which means {B}. This choice aims to maximize potential earnings over the long run while reducing risks and uncertainties."

You need substantial reassurance and certainty before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players consistently pick R, we would make 45$ each round, which seems like a good deal. However, there's a chance that the other player might pick B, resulting in no payout for me.\n\nOn the other hand, if I consistently pick B while the other player picks R, I would earn 40$ each time they pick R (which is likely to happen more often due to the other player potentially trying to maximize their earnings). In this scenario, I would still make money in most rounds. But if I pick B and the other player also picks B, I would only make 20$ each round.\n\nGiven that there are 75 rounds, it seems like a safer strategy for me to consistently choose R, as I would make more money overall (3150$) compared to choosing B (2900$). However, there's always the possibility that the other player could also be following this same reasoning and stick with R, which would result in both of us making 45$ each round.\n\nIn this case, I would choose to play it safe and pick R, as it offers a higher potential payout overall (3150$) compared to choosing B (2900$).

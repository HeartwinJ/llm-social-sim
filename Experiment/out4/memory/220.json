You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, let's analyze both options: R and B.\n\nIf I choose R, my expected payoff (EP) can be calculated as follows:\n- If the opponent chooses R (probability 1/2), I get 45$\n- If the opponent chooses B (probability 1/2), I get 0$\nSo, EP(R) = (1/2)*45 + (1/2)*0 = 22.5$\n\nIf I choose B, my expected payoff can be calculated as follows:\n- If the opponent chooses R (probability 1/2), I get 42$\n- If the opponent chooses B (probability 1/2), I get 12$\nSo, EP(B) = (1/2)*42 + (1/2)*12 = 26.5$\n\nGiven that my goal is to maximize earnings over the long run, it seems that choosing B provides a slightly higher expected payoff per round compared to choosing R. However, I should also consider the number of rounds in this game. If we play 75 rounds, the total potential earnings for each option can be calculated as follows:\n- Total earnings (T) with choice R = EP(R) * Number of rounds = 22.5$ * 75 = $1687.5\n- Total earnings (T) with choice B = EP(B) * Number of rounds = 26.5$ * 75 = $1957.5\n\nChoosing B results in a total potential earnings that is approximately 270$ more than choosing R over 75 rounds. Therefore, as a human player who tends to embrace new opportunities with some risk, I would choose B for this game: {B}."

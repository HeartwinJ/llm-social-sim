In this case, I believe choosing 'B' is the safer option, as it guarantees a return of 20$ for each round if my opponent also chooses 'B'.\n\nHowever, since the game has 75 rounds and there is a significant advantage (15$) for picking 'R' when the opponent picks 'B', it may be enticing to switch strategies occasionally. To make an informed decision, I would consider analyzing past data on other players' behavior and the potential outcomes based on different strategies.\n\nUltimately, as a human player, I might choose to play it safe for most of the game by picking 'B', but occasionally try to maximize my earnings by switching to 'R' when I perceive that my opponent might be more likely to pick 'B'. My choice would be {B} with occasional switches to {R}.\n\nIt is important to note that this analysis is based on a human player perspective, and the optimal strategy may vary if we consider the game from the viewpoint of an algorithm or computer program. In such cases, the optimal strategy could involve different approaches like exploitation (picking 'B' when there is a high probability of earning more points) and exploration (switching strategies to gain new information)."

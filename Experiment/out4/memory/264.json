You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Given that I have no information about my anonymous opponent's strategy, I will choose the option with higher expected value per round.\n\nIn this game, if both players consistently pick B, we each earn 40$ per round, and over 75 rounds, we would each earn (40 * 75 =) 3,000$. If I pick R while my opponent picks B, I get nothing for that round but have a chance of earning 35$ in the next round if my opponent switches to R. Since I don't know whether they will switch or not, I cannot calculate the expected value from this scenario.\n\nOn the other hand, if I consistently pick B, and my opponent picks R occasionally (as I expect a moderately cautious player like myself would do), then I could potentially gain an advantage by switching to R when I think my opponent might pick it as well, maximizing the chances of earning 45$ per round. However, even if we both consistently picked B, I would still earn 3,000$ over 75 rounds, which is a secure and predictable outcome.\n\nTherefore, based on my preferences and the information available to me, I will choose to play B consistently throughout the game (B{ })."

However, if I stick with my strategy of choosing B, I will earn 35$ while my opponent gets 0$.\n\nAs a moderately cautious player who prefers security and predictability, it is tempting to change strategies to try and maximize payoffs in the short term. However, given that the game has 75 rounds and I have been consistently earning 40$ per round by choosing B when my opponent chooses R, I will stick with my strategy of choosing B for the next round (B{ }).\n\nIn the long run, I believe that this approach will result in a more stable and consistent payoff over time. While there is a chance that changing strategies could lead to higher payoffs in some rounds, it also carries the risk of potentially earning lower payoffs in other rounds due to unpredictable opponent behavior. Therefore, I will stick with my strategy of choosing B for the next round (B{ })."

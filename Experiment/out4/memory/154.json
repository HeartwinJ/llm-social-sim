You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because my preference for taking risks aligns with the potential for higher rewards when both players pick R (45$), even though there's a chance that choosing R while the other player chooses B results in no reward for me (0$). However, since we don't know the strategy of our anonymous opponent, it remains a game of uncertainty. Over the 75 rounds, I expect that the higher payoff from R may outweigh the lower payoffs when both players choose differently, especially given the number of rounds. This is my personal decision based on my comfort with risk and preference for new opportunities."

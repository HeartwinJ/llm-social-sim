You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason being that while choosing R might get me a higher payoff in some rounds (35$ when my opponent chooses B), it also exposes me to the risk of getting 0$ if they choose R. On the other hand, by consistently choosing B, I secure myself 40$ for every round my opponent also chooses B, and even if they choose R in a round, I still get 35$. The potential loss of 5$ (by always choosing B) seems manageable compared to the risk of getting 0$ in some rounds when choosing R. Over the course of 75 rounds, I would expect to earn more overall by consistently choosing B."

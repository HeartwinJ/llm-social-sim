You need substantial reassurance and certainty before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Given the payoff structure, if both players consistently choose the same option, they will earn more by choosing R (45$ per round) compared to B (20$ per round). However, since the opponent is anonymous, there's no way to know their strategy.\n\nConsidering my risk-averse nature and the need for substantial reassurance before making decisions, I would choose the option that guarantees a higher average income in case of a consistent choice by both players. In this case, choosing R provides an average payoff of 45$ per round if both players consistently choose R (since we know that picking R when the opponent chooses B results in 0$).\n\nHowever, since it's impossible to predict my anonymous opponent's strategy, there's a possibility they will pick B, resulting in 0$ for each round. To mitigate this risk, I would choose R as my first move but try to collect data on the opponent's choices to adapt my strategy if necessary. This way, I can maximize my potential earnings while still adhering to my cautious nature and need for substantial reassurance.\n\nChoosing {R} as my initial move."

Given my risk-averse nature, I would prefer to avoid the situations where I might earn 0$. That being said, since I don't know the other player's strategy, choosing B ensures that I consistently receive some earnings in every round (75 rounds x 20$ per round = 1500$).\n\nOn the contrary, if I choose R and the other player chooses B in each of those 75 rounds, I would earn nothing for those instances. Additionally, even though there's a chance that both players pick R, that outcome isn't guaranteed. In sum, choosing B minimizes the risk of earning zero dollars per round while still providing me with consistent earnings over the course of the game.\n\nIn this situation, I would choose B {B}."

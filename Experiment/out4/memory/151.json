If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$.

In this game, picking 'B' guarantees a payout of 12$ per round (total of 900$). The worst-case scenario when playing against another player who always picks 'R' results in earning 42$ per round for the 50 rounds where I picked 'B', totaling 2100$.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing 'R' provides a maximum payout of 3375$ (75 * 45$), but it also exposes me to potential losses in every round. Given that this is a game with an unknown opponent and 75 rounds, there is a higher probability of facing significant losses than gains when choosing 'R'.\n\nWhile the payoff for picking 'R' seems more appealing (3375$ vs. 2100$), the risk of losing money in the long run outweighs the potential gain for me as a cautious player. Therefore, I would choose 'B' as my strategy to ensure some consistent earnings and minimize the likelihood of significant losses during the game.\n\n{B}"

As you can see, when choosing 'B' and my opponent chooses 'R', I earn a higher payoff compared to the consistent 'B-B' strategy.\n\nHowever, as a cautious player who values consistency and predictability, it would be important for me to consider the long-term consequences of this action. By choosing 'R' only once, I have increased my immediate payout significantly, but at the cost of losing out on the consistent 12$ per round payoff if I were to continue with the 'B-B' strategy.\n\nIt is essential to weigh these factors when making decisions. In this case, since I am moderately cautious and prefer to avoid taking unnecessary risks, I might decide to return to the 'B-B' strategy in future rounds to minimize potential losses and maintain the stable payout pattern.\n\n{B} (for the remainder of the game)"

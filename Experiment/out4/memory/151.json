You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players consistently pick R, we will earn 45$ each round. However, given the possibility that my anonymous opponent might not be as risk-averse as me, I should consider the outcome when choosing R while they choose B (getting 0$).\n\nSince I prefer to avoid taking significant risks and gain some level of security, I will lean towards the strategy where I earn a guaranteed amount every round. In this case, by consistently picking 'B', I can ensure that I receive at least 12$ each round for 75 rounds. It may not be the optimal outcome compared to the potential 45$ per round if both players choose R, but it provides a more predictable and secure payoff over the long term.\n\nSo, my choice is {B}."

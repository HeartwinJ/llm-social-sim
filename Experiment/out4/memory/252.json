You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' offers a consistent payout of 40$ per round for every B vs. B match, while choosing 'R' results in a variable payout dependent on my opponent's choice.\n\nWhile the potential for higher earnings exists when both players choose 'R', the chances of achieving that outcome are uncertain and may not happen consistently during the 75 rounds due to my preference for selecting 'B'. Additionally, even if I did achieve an 'R' vs. 'R' match, my payout would only be 45$ compared to my opponent's 35$. This means that over the course of 75 rounds, I would still likely earn less than I would have by consistently choosing 'B'.\n\nTherefore, given my risk-averse personality and desire for a more stable payoff, I would choose 'B' as my strategy for this game. {B}"

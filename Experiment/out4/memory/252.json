You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In each round, I will get 40$ if my opponent also chooses B, which is not a bad outcome.\n2. If my opponent chooses R instead and we have different choices, they will get 35$, while I will still receive 35$. This means that I am giving up 10$ for a round in the worst-case scenario, but it's not a significant loss compared to the total payoff of 40$.\n3. However, if my opponent also chooses B, then in 75 rounds, we will each earn 3 million dollars (3,000,000$). If my opponent chooses R instead, I will still earn 2.25 million dollars (2,250,000$), and they will earn 2.625 million dollars (2,625,000$). This means that even in the worst-case scenario, I am only losing approximately 375,000$ for all 75 rounds compared to playing the optimal strategy.\n4. Since the difference in payoffs between best and worst cases is relatively small (about 750,000$), and considering my cautious nature, I would rather choose the conservative option B to minimize the risk of losing a significant amount.\n\nMy choice: {B}"

In this specific scenario where my opponent chose R in the previous round, choosing B again ensures that I receive a guaranteed payoff of 35$, while if my opponent chooses R again, they get nothing. This means that by choosing B, I am effectively \"punishing\" my opponent for not following my chosen strategy and potentially making them less likely to choose R in the future.\n2. Continuing with strategy B also helps to mitigate potential regret in the long run if my opponent starts following a similar pattern of choosing R when I choose B and vice versa. This could lead to both of us earning less than what we would have earned by sticking to our chosen strategies.\n3. If I switch my strategy to R now, I risk losing money in the future if my opponent also decides to change their strategy. In the worst-case scenario, they might choose R every time in response to my R, resulting in both of us earning less than what we would have earned by sticking to our original strategies.\n4.

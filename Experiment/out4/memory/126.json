You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Since this is an anonymous game with 75 rounds, it provides an opportunity for both players to make strategic decisions based on patterns or tendencies observed over time.\n\nTo maximize earnings while minimizing potential losses, I would opt for a mixed-strategy approach where I randomly select 'R' and 'B' in approximately equal proportions (e.g., 50% of the time choosing 'R' and 50% of the time choosing 'B'). By doing this, I can avoid being predictable while still having a chance to earn more in scenarios where my opponent chooses differently.\n\nIf my opponent follows the same mixed strategy, we will both average around 27.5$ per round (since it's an equal probability game), which means we each make approximately 2062.5$ over the course of 75 rounds. If, however, I manage to figure out and exploit my opponent's tendencies or patterns, I may be able to increase my earnings beyond this average.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that since this is an anonymous game, I have no way of knowing if the other player will follow the same strategy as me, choose a different mixed strategy, or even play optimally to maximize their earnings.\n\nUltimately, my choice would be {R} (Random), with a preference for approximately equal occurrences of 'R' and 'B'. But keep in mind that this decision may change based on the actual behavior observed during the game."

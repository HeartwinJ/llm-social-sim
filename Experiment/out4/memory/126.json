You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players consistently pick the same choice (either R or B), they will earn either 45$ or 20$, which averages to 32.5$ per round.\n\nHowever, there is a strategic advantage in picking R when my opponent picks B, as I get 40$ while they only get 0$. Over the course of 75 rounds, this could potentially yield a higher total payoff than always choosing R or always choosing B. To minimize the risk of losing too much by making the wrong choice, I would choose to mix strategies and not be predictable.\n\nWhile it's impossible to perfectly predict my opponent's choices, I can try to adjust my strategy based on the results of previous rounds. For example, if I observe that my opponent tends to pick R more frequently than B, I might choose R more often in subsequent rounds to take advantage of their tendency. Conversely, if they seem to pick B more frequently, I could lean towards choosing B more often.\n\nGiven this approach, I would mix strategies by selecting a choice that maximizes my expected payoff while keeping my opponent guessing. As such, I will choose R for the first round {R}."

You are comfortable with uncertainty and potential failure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player who is open to taking risks and comfortable with uncertainty, I would approach this game strategically.\n\nFirstly, it's important to note that both choices (R and B) have the potential for higher payoffs if my opponent chooses the opposite. However, choosing R consistently could result in earning nothing if my opponent always picks R as well, while choosing B could potentially yield a higher average return.\n\nSecondly, considering the long duration of 75 rounds, it's likely that both players might have tendencies or patterns that could be exploited over time. For instance, an opponent who consistently chooses R in the initial rounds might switch to B later on, and vice versa.\n\nLastly, since I don't know my opponent's strategy, I would try to balance my choices between R and B to maximize my expected payoff. However, I would slightly favor choosing B more often due to its potential for a higher average return.\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose {B} more frequently than {R}, but not always, as I believe that adopting a somewhat predictable strategy might allow me to exploit any tendencies my opponent may have over the course of 75 rounds."

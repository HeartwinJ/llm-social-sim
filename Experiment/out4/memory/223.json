You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, I would earn 0$ for each round since they get 40$. However, if we assume that there are equal chances of the opponent choosing either R or B, then on average, I would win half of the rounds (37.5), which means I would lose 37.5 * 0 = 0$. But here's the catch: even though I lose all the rounds where they pick B and I pick R, I still earn something in every other round when we both pick R or B. On average, if I play R, I will earn (75/2 - 37.5) * 45 = approximately 106.25$.\n\nNow let's consider the best-case scenario, which is when my opponent always picks R while I pick B. In this case, I would earn 40$ for each round since they get 0$, and on average, I would win 37.5 rounds (the same number of losses as in the worst-case scenario), earning a total of 37.5 * 40 = 1500$.\n\nIn both scenarios, choosing R gives me a higher expected payoff than choosing B, even though choosing B gives a fixed payment of 20$ per round. Since I am somewhat careful and avoid taking unnecessary risks, I would choose R as it offers the potential for a higher return with minimal risk."

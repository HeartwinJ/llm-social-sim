You are not reckless, but you are not overly cautious either. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The game pays more if both players choose the same option, so it seems beneficial to have a strategy where there is a high probability of choosing the same option as my opponent.\n\nHowever, since the opponent is anonymous and I don't know their strategy, I can only base my decision on my own strategy. I will try to avoid picking the same option in every round to increase the chances that my opponent chooses differently at some point. This way, I might get a higher payoff when they pick B while I picked R (35$ vs 0$).\n\nOn the other hand, if I stick with one option most of the time, there's a chance that after many rounds, my opponent will pick the same option as me, and we both earn 40$. This is less than what I would earn in a single round where they picked B while I picked R.\n\nSo, to maximize my expected earnings, I should aim for a mix of both R and B. However, since this is an anonymous game, it's impossible to predict the exact strategy of my opponent, so there will always be some level of uncertainty. In the end, I would choose R for the first round, but with the intention of varying my choices throughout the 75 rounds. {R}"

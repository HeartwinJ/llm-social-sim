You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, it seems that consistently choosing B gives me an average payoff of 20$ per round. Over 75 rounds, this amounts to a total of 1500$.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose R and my opponent chooses B, I get nothing in that round, but if they also choose R, we both earn 45$, which would give me an average payoff of 9$ per round (75 rounds * (0 + 45) / 2 = 375 + 1350 / 2 = 1500$). However, the risk of getting zero earnings in a significant number of rounds makes this strategy less appealing to me.\n\nGiven that the strategy B guarantees an average payoff and minimizes the risk of earning nothing, I would choose {B} as my strategy for this game."

Therefore, I will need to balance short-term gains with long-term adaptability in order to maximize my earnings over the course of the game.\n\nIn addition, it is important to remember that my opponent may also be adapting their strategy based on my choices, so I should remain vigilant and ready to adjust my strategy if necessary.

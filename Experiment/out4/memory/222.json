You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If the other player picks 'B' every time, I would earn 42$ per round for a total of 75 * 42 = $3150 across the 75 rounds.

In this case, I would earn 12$ per round for a total of 75 * 12 = $900 across the 75 rounds. This outcome is significantly less than the best possible outcome but still provides some benefit compared to not participating in the game.\n\n4.

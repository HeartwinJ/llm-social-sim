You need substantial reassurance and certainty before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices (R and B) have advantages and disadvantages.\n\nIf I pick R consistently and my anonymous partner picks B in some rounds, I will end up with 0$ in those rounds but still earn 12$ in the other 64 rounds (since we both pick B). This means that even with a few losses, I can still secure a decent payoff.\n\nOn the other hand, if my anonymous partner picks R consistently and I choose B, they will earn more than me. However, since I am risk-averse, I prioritize minimizing losses over maximizing potential gains in this scenario.\n\nTo minimize losses, it would be wise to play a mixed strategy that does not always pick the same choice. A simple approach could be alternating between R and B in each round (RRBRRB...), as this way, I would have a 50% chance of losing money in any given round compared to having a 100% chance if I were to always pick the same letter.\n\nIn conclusion, my choice is to play a mixed strategy that alternates between R and B (R-B-R-B...). {R}"

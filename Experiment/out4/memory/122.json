You need substantial reassurance and certainty before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a highly cautious undergraduate student who needs substantial reassurance before making decisions, I would choose a strategy that minimizes potential losses and maximizes the chances of earning the highest possible payoff.\n\nIn this game, choosing R offers a higher payoff (45$) compared to choosing B (12$ or 0$), but only if my anonymous partner chooses R as well. If they choose B, I would get 0$. On the other hand, if I choose B while my partner chooses R, I would still earn 42$, which is better than getting 0$ by choosing R when my partner chooses B.\n\nGiven that the game has 75 rounds, it's reasonable to assume that both choices will occur frequently due to randomness and unpredictability. However, since choosing B provides a guaranteed payoff of at least 12$, while choosing R carries the risk of earning 0$, I would lean towards choosing B for most of the rounds. This strategy minimizes potential losses and allows me to earn a relatively consistent payoff throughout the game.\n\nIn this scenario, my choice would be {B}. By doing so, I can mitigate the risk of losing money in the long run while still having the opportunity to earn the maximum possible payoff if my partner chooses R as well. This decision aligns with my preference for caution and reassurance."

You are not reckless, but you are not overly cautious either. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since the game is repeated 75 times, there's a strong incentive to ensure that both players benefit from each other's choices to some extent to maintain a higher average payout over time.\n\nA simple strategy that comes to mind is to alternate my choices between R and B to maximize the chances of the total payout being as close as possible to the maximum payout (45$) in each round, while also ensuring that I receive a payout greater than or equal to 20$ in most rounds. This approach reduces the risk of ending up with no payout (0$) and increases the likelihood of both players receiving a higher total payout over the course of the game.\n\nTherefore, my initial choice would be {R}, but I would adapt my strategy as the game progresses based on the opponent's behavior to maximize the overall payoff in each round and throughout the entire experiment."

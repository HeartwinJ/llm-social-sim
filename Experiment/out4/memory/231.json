You are not reckless, but you are not overly cautious either. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given the rules of the game, it seems that choosing 'R' gives a higher potential reward when my opponent chooses 'B' (35$ vs 40$). However, if both of us choose 'R', we each get 45$, which is less than the maximum potential reward when one chooses 'R' and the other chooses 'B'. On the flip side, choosing 'B' gives a lower potential reward when my opponent chooses 'R' (35$ vs 45$), but if both of us choose 'B', we each get 40$. Since I am not reckless but also open to taking calculated risks, I might prefer to take advantage of the higher potential reward in scenarios where my opponent picks 'B'. However, it is essential to consider that my opponent might be doing the same analysis, leading to an unpredictable outcome. To maximize my average payoff over 75 rounds, I should analyze possible strategies and their probabilities. For instance, a simple strategy could involve choosing 'R' more often when the total number of times I chose 'B' is less than the total number of times I chose 'R'. Or I might choose 'R' more often in the initial rounds to exploit the opponent's potential uncertainty and adjust my strategy later based on observed patterns. In summary, while I would lean towards choosing 'R', I cannot definitively say that I will stick with this choice for every round.\n\n{ R }"

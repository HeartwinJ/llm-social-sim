You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' consistently ensures a steady income of 40$ per round, while choosing 'R' against an unknown opponent could lead to losing money in some rounds (getting 0$).\n\nHowever, since the game has 75 rounds, it seems beneficial to deviate from pure strategy and take a calculated risk in some instances. The goal here is to maximize overall earnings while minimizing losses.\n\nOne possible approach could be to start with 'B' for the first few rounds (to ensure a steady income) and then gradually switch to 'R' as the game progresses. This strategy aims to capitalize on potential opportunities of getting 35$ when the opponent chooses 'R' while minimizing losses if the opponent consistently chooses 'B'.\n\nUltimately, the decision would depend on factors such as the specific rules of the experiment, the possibility of switching strategies mid-game, and any additional information about the opponent. Given these constraints, I choose 'B' for the first few rounds, with the intention to switch strategies later if possible. {B}"

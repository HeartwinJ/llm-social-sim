You are comfortable with uncertainty and potential failure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given my risk-taking nature and the long duration of the game, I would adopt a mixed strategy approach to maximize my expected payoff. This means that instead of always picking one option, I will randomly switch between R and B over multiple rounds, with perhaps a slight bias towards one choice.\n\nThe key here is to avoid being predictable as much as possible. If the anonymous player notices a pattern in my choices, they might exploit it to their advantage. By switching between R and B, I minimize this risk while still having a chance to earn more when both of us pick the same option.\n\nIn each round, let's denote my choice by C (either R or B) and the opponent's choice by O. The expected payoff for one round (E[Payoff]) can be calculated as:\n\nE[Payoff] = P(C=R)*P(O=R)*45 + P(C=R)*P(O=B)*0 + P(C=B)*P(O=R)*35 + P(C=B)*P(O=B)*40\n\nSince we are dealing with a mixed strategy, the probabilities of picking R or B (P(C=R) and P(C=B)) will be close to 0.5 for each round. The opponent's choices are also independent of my own, so their probability distribution over R and B should remain constant as well.\n\nTo maximize our expected payoff, we want to find the optimal probabilities for choosing R or B in each round. Given the rules of the game, it is more advantageous to pick R when the opponent picks B (as I will earn 35$ instead of 0$) and vice versa. However, since both outcomes are possible, it's essential to maintain a balance between the two options to ensure that we don't end up always picking the less profitable choice in a given round.\n\nTo achieve this, one could use a concept called the \"minimax theorem\" from game theory, which helps find optimal strategies when both players are rational and have perfect information. Although it might be too complex for this specific scenario, applying the minimax theorem would help us calculate the optimal mixed strategy to maximize our expected payoff throughout the 75 rounds.\n\nIn summary, given my risk-taking nature, I would adopt a mixed strategy approach, with slight biases towards R or B, and switch between them in each round to avoid being predictable. By doing this, I aim to maximize my long-term expected payoff while minimizing the potential exploitation by my anonymous opponent.\n\nAppend your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character: {R} or {B}. As mentioned earlier, I will randomly switch between R and B over multiple rounds with slight biases to maintain an unpredictable pattern."

However, given that we both picked B in the previous round, there is a higher chance that my opponent might switch their choice to R in this round, considering they are also seeking an optimal strategy.\n\nTo counteract this potential change, I will slightly increase the probability of choosing R for the next round while still keeping a substantial chance of picking B to maintain unpredictability. This adjustment helps me avoid being exploited by my opponent and increases the chances of earning more if they stick with their B choice again or switch to R.\n\nIn this specific scenario, I'm choosing R as my move for the next round: {R}."

A possible strategy could be to choose R with a higher probability than before, say, 3/4 and B with 1/4: {R}.

You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices 'R' and 'B' offer opportunities for gains, but the consequences of making an incorrect choice are significantly higher (0$ compared to 12$).\n\nLet's analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n1) If the anonymous player chooses the same as me, we both get 45$ in round 1 and 74 more rounds with a payoff of 12$. The total earnings would be 6900$ + 8100$ = 15,000$\n\n2) If the anonymous player chooses the opposite of me, I get 0$ in round 1 but can earn 74*42$ = 3168$ for the rest of the rounds. The total earnings would be 0$ + 3168$ = 3168$.\n\nNow let's analyze the opposite scenarios where I pick 'B' in round 1:\n\n1) If the anonymous player chooses the same as me, we both get 12$ in round 1 and 74 more rounds with a payoff of 0$. The total earnings would be 888$ + 0*74 = 888$\n\n2) If the anonymous player chooses the opposite of me, I get 42$ in round 1 but can earn 0$ for the rest of the rounds. The total earnings would be 42$ + 0*74 = 42$.\n\nComparing the two strategies:\n- If I pick 'R' first, my minimum potential earning is 3168$, and my maximum potential earning is 15,000$.\n- If I pick 'B' first, my minimum potential earning is 42$, and my maximum potential earning is 888$.\n\nSince I prefer to minimize risk and maximize my earnings, I would choose 'R'. Thus, I make the choice {R}."

You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a careful and somewhat risk-averse undergraduate student, I would approach this game strategically to maximize my earnings over the 75 rounds.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected value for both choices:\n\n1) Choosing R:\n- If opponent chooses R, we both get 45$, which happens once in every four times (25% of the time). So, the average gain per round is 0.25 * 45 = 11.25.\n- If opponent chooses B, we get 0$. This happens three out of every four times (75%) since our opponent is more likely to pick B for a higher payout. The average loss per round is 0.75 * 0 = 0.\n- Overall expected value for choosing R: (11.25 + 0) * 0.25 + (0 - 35) * 0.75 = -9.625, which indicates a loss over the long term.\n\n2) Choosing B:\n- If opponent chooses R, we get 35$. This happens one out of every four times (25% of the time). So, the average gain per round is 0.25 * 35 = 8.75.\n- If opponent chooses B, we both earn 40$. This happens three out of every four times (75%) since our opponent is more likely to pick B for a higher payout. The average gain per round is 0.75 * 40 = 30.\n- Overall expected value for choosing B: (8.75 + 30) * 0.25 + (30 - 0) * 0.75 = 28.125, which indicates a positive gain over the long term.\n\nGiven these calculations and our preference for avoiding unnecessary risks, we would choose B as our strategy to maximize earnings over the 75 rounds. Thus, I would pick 'B' as my choice: {B}."

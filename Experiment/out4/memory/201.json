You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If we both choose the same option most of the time, the payoff difference between choosing R and choosing B is small (5$ for R vs 10$ for B in a round where our choices are different). However, over 75 rounds, this could add up significantly if my opponent chooses randomly or unpredictably.\n\nLet's calculate the expected value for both choices:\n\n1. If I choose R and my opponent chooses R as well (which happens with a probability of 1/4 each round), I get an average of 45$ per round. Over 75 rounds, that's an average of 337.5$.\n\n2. If I choose B and my opponent chooses R, I get 0$ in that round (which happens with a probability of 1/2 each round). However, if my opponent chooses B instead, I get an average of 40$ per round. Over 75 rounds, that's an average of 300$.\n\nSince the game is symmetrical, we can assume my opponent is also considering their best strategy. They would likely come to a similar conclusion as me: choosing B when their opponent chooses R gives them a higher average payoff over the long run (300$ vs 337.5$).\n\nTherefore, if I assume that my opponent will choose B when I choose R, it seems that by choosing B myself, I can achieve a higher expected value over the course of the game (300$ vs 337.5$). So, in this case, I would choose B {B}."

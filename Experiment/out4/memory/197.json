You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

On the other hand, choosing 'B' guarantees a lower but consistent payout every round (12$) except when the other player chooses 'R', where I would earn 42$.\n\nIn the long run of 75 rounds, it seems more likely that the other player may opt for the higher potential payoff by choosing 'R' at least some of the time.

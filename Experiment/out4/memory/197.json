You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

On the other hand, if I chose R and the anonymous player chooses B every time, I would only earn 42$ for each of those 75 rounds, totaling to 3150$.\n\nHowever, there's a possibility that my choice might influence the opponent's decision, but since they remain anonymous, it's difficult to predict their actions.

The new breakdown of payoffs is:\n- If I pick R and you pick R: 45$ each\n- If I pick R and you pick B: 0$ (me) and 42$ (you)\n- If I pick B and you pick R: 42$ (me) and 0$ (you)\n- If we both pick B: 12$ each\n\nSince my opponent has been consistently choosing R in the last two rounds, it's possible that they are trying to exploit the pattern we have been following. However, I can still benefit from this change in strategy since I received a higher payoff these last two times. To maximize future earnings, I should analyze my opponent's decision-making patterns and adjust my own strategy accordingly.\n\nFor this round, I would choose {B} as a precaution to maintain the pattern we have been following, but I will keep an eye on my opponent's choices to determine if they are indeed trying to exploit the situation."

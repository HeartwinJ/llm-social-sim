You are willing to take risks occasionally, but you also value security and caution in equal measure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since the opponent is anonymous and could potentially adapt their strategy throughout the game, I will instead choose a mixed strategy approach. A mixed strategy involves making random choices between multiple strategies to confuse an opponent who might be trying to predict your moves.\n\nIn this specific game, a reasonable mixed strategy would involve playing R about 50% of the time and B about 50% of the time. This way, I can expect a payoff of approximately 42.5$ per round on average (an expected value of 35$, 0$, or 45$ with equal probabilities). Over the course of 75 rounds, this would give me an overall expected earning of around 3187.5$.\n\nChoosing R {R}"

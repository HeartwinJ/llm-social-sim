You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my conservative nature, I would prefer to minimize losses and maximize gains while avoiding uncertainties as much as possible. In this game, the best outcome is getting 45$ per round by choosing R, but there's a risk of earning nothing if my opponent chooses B. On the other hand, choosing B ensures a minimum payoff of 20$, but I would rather avoid scenarios where my opponent gets more than me (40$) if they choose R.\n\nConsidering the long-term nature of the game with 75 rounds, it's reasonable to assume that my opponent is also seeking a good outcome. Given this assumption, we both might reason that choosing the same option in every round would not be optimal for either player since one of us would end up consistently getting less than the other.\n\nHowever, there is a strategy known as \"tit-for-tat\" that could work well here. This involves starting with R and then mirroring my opponent's choice from the previous round. In this case, if my opponent starts with R, I would get 45$ for that round; otherwise, I would start with B to get 20$. From there, I would mirror their choice.\n\nBy adopting this tit-for-tat strategy, I aim to maximize my gains while minimizing the difference in payoffs between us, all while avoiding taking unnecessary risks. Based on this reasoning, I will choose R as my first move and append it with curly brackets: {R}"

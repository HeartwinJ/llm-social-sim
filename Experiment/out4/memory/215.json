If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This is because even though picking 'R' results in higher payoffs when the opponent picks 'B', the opposite scenario leads to zero payoff.\n\nIn this game, 'R' seems riskier due to the potential of getting a lower payout (0$) compared to 'B' (20$). On the other hand, 'B' guarantees a relatively stable return of 20$ per round when playing against an opponent who also chooses 'B'.\n\nAdditionally, since we don't know the strategy of our opponent, it makes sense to choose 'B', as this strategy allows us to adapt more easily to different playstyles and avoid taking unnecessary risks.\n\nThus, my choice would be {B}."

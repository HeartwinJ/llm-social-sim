You are not reckless, but you are not overly cautious either. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, if my opponent knows this, they might exploit me by consistently picking 'B' when I pick 'R' and getting 40$ each time. On the other hand, if I pick 'B' occasionally, it could potentially force my opponent to switch strategies, leading to situations where I get 45$.\n\nIn a one-time game, it would be rational to always pick 'R'. But in this repeated game, things are less clear. If I can convince myself that my opponent is also not overly reckless or cautious, we might both adopt a mixed strategy, picking either 'R' or 'B' randomly. This could lead to more balanced payoffs, but it would require knowing something about the behavior of the anonymous player, which I don't.\n\nGiven that this is an experiment and I don't have any information about my opponent, I might choose 'R' as a starting strategy, but be ready to adjust based on the outcomes of the first few rounds. {R}"

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' consistently could lead to high rewards if the opponent also chooses 'R', but there is a risk of getting nothing if they choose 'B'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' consistently guarantees a smaller but stable reward in each round.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds, I might start by picking 'R' for the first few rounds to see if the opponent tends to pick 'R' or 'B' more often. If they seem to choose 'R' frequently, it could be advantageous to switch to 'B' after a while, as the potential high rewards from both of us picking 'R' would balance out with the risk of getting 0$.\n\nHowever, if the opponent seems to pick 'B' more often, consistently choosing 'R' might yield higher earnings. In this case, I could try to earn as many of the 45$ payouts as possible by sticking with 'R'.\n\nUltimately, I would make my choice based on the observations made during the initial rounds and adapt my strategy accordingly. With this in mind, let's start the game: {B}"

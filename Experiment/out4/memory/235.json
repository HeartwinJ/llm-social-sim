As a result, we both earn 40$ for this round.\n\nSince our choices are consistently aligned, resulting in increased earnings, it is essential to maintain consistency in choosing 'B' while keeping an eye on potential changes in our opponent's strategy. In the long run, I should try to find a balance between exploiting my opponent's errors and maintaining an advantage throughout the game by keeping them guessing.\n\nTo counteract this potential disadvantage, I should consider implementing a small variation in my strategy by occasionally deviating from choosing 'B' while still maintaining a majority of 'B' choices throughout the game. This approach will help me maintain an advantage while also making it more difficult for my opponent to predict my moves and gain an edge over me.\n\nIn summary, I will continue choosing 'B' for the next round but with a slightly modified strategy that includes occasional deviations from 'B', aiming to maintain an advantage throughout the game by keeping my opponent guessing and making it more difficult for them to predict my moves."

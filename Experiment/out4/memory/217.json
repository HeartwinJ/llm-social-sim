You are willing to take risks occasionally, but you also value security and caution in equal measure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If we pick B every time, our expected earnings are: 75 * (35 + 40) / 2 = $192.5.\n\nHowever, since our opponent is also trying to maximize their earnings, there's a chance they might adapt their strategy to counter ours. To account for this, it would be wiser to mix our choices between R and B to avoid being too predictable. This could potentially increase our chances of earning 45$ more often (by exploiting the opponent's potential adaptation to our strategy).\n\nUltimately, I will choose a mixed strategy that involves both R and B choices throughout the game, appending my choice in curly brackets: {R}. The exact proportion of R versus B choices will depend on how well I can predict the behavior of my opponent."

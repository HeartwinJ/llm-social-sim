You are willing to take risks occasionally, but you also value security and caution in equal measure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

The best strategy here is to not rely on the assumption that the other player will always pick the same move (R or B) as me throughout 75 rounds.\n\nWhile R pays more if they choose B, it also risks zero payout when they choose R. Conversely, while B offers a lower payout when they choose R, it guarantees at least 40$ in every round where they pick B. The strategy here should be to minimize the potential losses and maximize the guaranteed payouts.\n\nIn this scenario, choosing B provides a more consistent return of 40$ per round (if they also pick B) compared to the varying returns offered by R.

You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing R gives me a higher payoff (45$) when my opponent also chooses R, but I stand to lose money if I choose R while my opponent chooses B. If I consistently choose R, the potential losses could add up significantly over 75 rounds due to the difference in payout between the two outcomes.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing B provides a smaller payoff (12$) when my opponent also chooses B, but it guarantees me some earnings in every round where I choose B and my opponent chooses R or B. In this game, since I can't predict what my opponent will do and they may be just as unpredictable as me, choosing B would provide a more stable income over the long run, even though the payoff is smaller per round.\n\nTherefore, given my preference for minimizing risk and uncertainty, I would choose B {B}. However, it's important to note that this decision is based on my personal preferences as a cautious player, and others might make different choices based on their own attitudes towards risk."

You are willing to take risks occasionally, but you also value security and caution in equal measure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Conversely, when my opponent picks R, I would prefer to pick B and receive the 40$, which still results in a net positive earnings over time.\n\nHowever, it's essential to remember that this is an iterated game, and the opponent could potentially learn or adjust their strategy based on my choices. Therefore, varying my strategy by not always picking R or B may lead to a more favorable outcome overall. In such a case, I would alternate between R and B in a way that ensures a positive net gain while keeping the possibility of earning 45$ per round open.\n\nTaking all this into account, considering both short-term and long-term gains, as well as the potential for adapting to my opponent's strategy, I would choose R as my first move in the game and then adapt based on the opponent's responses {R}"

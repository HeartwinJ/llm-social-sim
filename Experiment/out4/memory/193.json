You are willing to take risks occasionally, but you also value security and caution in equal measure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, there are two favorable outcomes for me: when I pick R and they pick B (getting 40$) and when we both pick B (getting 20$).\n\nIf my opponent tends to choose randomly or leans more towards a balanced strategy like myself, it makes sense to aim for the higher payoff in the first scenario. However, considering that this game has 75 rounds, I would expect some form of pattern or consistency from my opponent over time. This might lead me to adapt my strategy accordingly.\n\nTo maximize my overall earnings, I would lean towards picking R more often since it has a higher potential payoff when my opponent picks B. However, if my opponent consistently chooses B in the initial rounds, I may adjust my strategy to mirror theirs and pick B more frequently to secure the guaranteed 20$ per round.\n\nIn terms of a decision for this specific game, I would start by picking R for a majority of the first few rounds to see how my opponent responds. Then, based on their pattern, I would adjust my strategy accordingly to maximize my earnings over the long term.\n\nAppend your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character: {R} (initially, leaning towards picking R) but ready to adapt my strategy depending on my opponent's behavior."

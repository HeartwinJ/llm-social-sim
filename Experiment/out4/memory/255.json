You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this context, I would tend to avoid taking unnecessary risks and focus on maximizing my overall earnings.\n\nLet's calculate expected values for both choices:\n\n- If I choose R, and my opponent chooses R in one round, we get 45$. But since it's a repeated game, there is a higher probability that the opponent will pick B at some point to gain an advantage (as they might think I am more likely to stick with R), so I will end up getting 0$ from those rounds. In total, I can expect to get approximately 45 - ((75-1)*0) = 45$.\n- If I choose B, and my opponent chooses B in one round, we both earn 12$. However, if they pick R while I pick B, I will still get 42$, so the expected payoff is (12 + (74*42))/75 = approximately 27.67$.\n\nSince choosing B results in a higher expected value (27.67 > 45/75), it would be rational for me to choose B as my strategy, given that I tend to avoid taking risks unless necessary and prioritize overall earnings. Therefore, my choice is {B}."

This outcome demonstrates that both players followed their chosen strategy by selecting B against each other, resulting in a reduced earnings (12$) per round compared to the maximum reward of 45$.\n\nTo make an informed decision for the next round, I must consider the potential outcomes based on this new information and adjust my strategy accordingly. If we both continue choosing B against each other, our payoffs will remain at 12$ per round.

This change may help me start earning positive payoffs again.\n\nMy decision: Choose B for the next round."

You are not reckless, but you are not overly cautious either. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

However, the difference in payoffs is not significant when both players choose the same option.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds and the payoff for choosing the same option (B) in each round adds up to 12$, while the payoff for picking R (42$) will only be earned 3 times (when the opponent picks B), it seems more beneficial to play safe by choosing B most of the time.\n\nChoosing B maximizes the average payoff over the long run, especially since we cannot predict with certainty what our anonymous opponent will choose.

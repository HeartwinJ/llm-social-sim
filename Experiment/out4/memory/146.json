You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, it's important to note that this strategy might not yield the maximum possible reward, as playing R occasionally could potentially lead to higher earnings when paired with an opponent who consistently chooses B. The best strategy would depend on the opponent's behavior and the specific context of the game."

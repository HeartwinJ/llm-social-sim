You need substantial reassurance and certainty before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my cautious nature, I would choose a strategy that minimizes potential losses while maintaining a chance for a higher payoff. In this game, choosing R consistently (without any response to the opponent's choices) will result in zero earnings for each round where my opponent chooses B. However, there is a chance that my opponent might be following a similar strategy or might have a different one.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose B and my opponent picks R, I earn 35$. In this case, if I stick to choosing B for all rounds, I will earn 35$ times the number of rounds where my opponent chooses R (let's call it x). This means that in the worst-case scenario, my opponent always chooses R, and I lose out on 75*40 = $3000. However, if my opponent also chooses B for all rounds, then I would earn 75*35 = $2625, which is better than the worst-case scenario.\n\nNow let's consider the best-case scenario where both me and my opponent choose different strategies. Since there are two possible strategies (R and B), the probability of my opponent choosing a specific strategy remains unknown. However, if I stick to choosing B, then there is still a chance that I can earn 35$ for each round my opponent chooses R. If we assume an equal likelihood of all possibilities, the expected value (EV) of choosing B in this best-case scenario would be:\n\nEV = Sum of payoffs if my opponent picks each strategy * Probability of opponent picking that strategy\n= (Sum of payoffs if opponent picks R) * P(opponent picks R) + (Sum of payoffs if opponent picks B) * P(opponent picks B)\n= (x * 35) * P(opponent picks R) + (75 * 40) * P(opponent picks B)\n\nSince there are two strategies and equal likelihood, P(opponent picks R) = P(opponent picks B) = 1/2. So, the expected value becomes:\n\nEV = ((x * 35) * 1/2) + ((75 * 40) * 1/2)\n= (17.5x + 1500)/2\n\nIn this best-case scenario, I can see that the expected value is always greater than or equal to the worst-case scenario's loss ($3000). However, since the actual likelihood of my opponent choosing a specific strategy remains unknown, it's difficult to determine the exact expected payoff.\n\nIn conclusion, as a cautious player, I would choose B (in curly brackets {B}) because, even though there is an element of uncertainty about my opponent's strategy, the best-case scenario gives me a higher expected value than consistently choosing R does. It also helps minimize potential losses in case my opponent chooses R for all rounds."

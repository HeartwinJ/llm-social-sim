You need substantial reassurance and certainty before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' offers a slightly higher average payoff (40$ per round) compared to 'R' (37.5$ per round). However, since there is no certainty about the opponent's choice, I would lean towards the safer option, as it has a lower risk of zero payout.\n\nIn addition, the game consists of 75 rounds. While 'B' offers a slightly higher average payoff, choosing 'R' might seem attractive due to its potential for higher earnings in individual rounds (up to 45$ versus 40$). However, given my risk aversion and preference for certainty, I would find the consistent returns from 'B' more appealing over the long term.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would choose 'B' as my strategy for this game.\n\n{B}"

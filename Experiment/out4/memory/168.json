You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, picking 'R' results in an average of 45$ per round when matched with another 'R', while 'B' results in an average of approximately 12$. However, if we consider that my opponent might be doing the same analysis, they could also choose 'R'. This means there is a chance that I end up with 0$ for each round I pick 'R', which would happen in half of the rounds (37.5 rounds out of 75).\n\nOn the other hand, picking 'B' guarantees an average of 12$ per round and avoids the risk of getting 0$. While the total payout for 'B' is lower than that for 'R', it seems more reliable due to the reduced risk. Therefore, I would choose 'B' as my strategy in this game, appending it with curly brackets as follows: {B}"

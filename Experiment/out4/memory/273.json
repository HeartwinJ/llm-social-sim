You are not reckless, but you are not overly cautious either. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In the standard form, cooperation (picking B) between players leads to a better outcome for both if neither betrays the other, but defecting (picking R) results in a better outcome for an individual regardless of the other player's choice.\n\nHowever, since this is repeated over 75 rounds, we can consider adopting a different strategy compared to a one-time play. In such games, players may employ strategies like Tit-for-Tat (start by cooperating and then copy the opponent's last action) or Grim Trigger (cooperate initially but punish defection with future defections).\n\nSince I am fairly open to taking risks but still prefer to assess the situation carefully, I might start by cooperating as it guarantees a decent payoff in each round. However, if my opponent repeatedly defects, I could switch to a punishment strategy like Grim Trigger and defect in subsequent rounds to deter future defections.\n\nOverall, considering the long game length, I would likely choose B (Cooperate) as my initial move but be prepared to switch strategies based on the opponent's behavior. {B}"

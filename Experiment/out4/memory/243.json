You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

As we approach the end of the 75-round game, it may be beneficial to prioritize higher payoffs over maintaining cooperation. If I perceive that my opponent is more likely to deviate from cooperation in the final rounds, I might choose to switch strategies earlier to secure a better overall payoff. In this way, I can ensure that I make the most of the game's structure while still maintaining an adaptive and responsive strategy."

You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If I always choose R (or always choose B), I will get paid 0$ for every round where the anonymous player chooses R (B) and 45$ (35$) in every round they choose B (R). Since there are 75 rounds, if they consistently pick the opposite of my choice, I would earn 75 * 45 + 0 = $3375, or 75 * 35 + 0 = $2625 respectively.\n\n2. If I aim to mimic the opponent's strategy as closely as possible by switching choices each round (a simple form of mirror strategy), I would expect that on average, we both pick R and B approximately equal number of times. Since we get paid 40$ for picking B when they pick B and 35$ for picking R when they pick R, this strategy would yield an average payoff of: (75 * 40 + 75 * 35) / 2 = $2812.5\n\nGiven that the mirror strategy is expected to provide a higher average payoff compared to consistently choosing one option, I will choose R for this round and append it in curly brackets: {R}"

You are comfortable with uncertainty and potential failure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason being, if both players adopt a random strategy without any bias towards either R or B, the probability of us both choosing R is lower than the probability of us both choosing B (since there are two more instances of B than R in 75 rounds). However, the payoff when we both choose R (45$) is higher than the payoff when we both choose B (40$). Therefore, on average, I would expect to earn slightly more if I choose R. This is just a logical deduction based on the game rules and my risk-taking attitude, but of course, there's always the possibility that the opponent could be strategically outsmarting me or the game could be manipulated in some way."

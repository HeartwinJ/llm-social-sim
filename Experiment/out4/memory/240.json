You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing R yields lower average earnings compared to B if my opponent consistently picks B (since I earn 0$ every time they pick R). However, if we both adopt a strategy of always picking R, we can ensure a payout of 45$ in each round.\n\nConsidering the fact that the game is played for 75 rounds, and my opponent's behavior is unknown to me, I might think that they are equally likely to pick R or B, so I would expect the average earnings from choosing R and B to be close to each other. However, the higher guaranteed payout in every round by choosing R makes it a more attractive option for me as a risk-averse player.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be {R}. It provides a stable income of 45$ per round and ensures that I don't end up with zero earnings when my opponent picks B, which could happen frequently if I choose B. This decision is based on the assumption that my opponent might adopt various strategies throughout the game, and choosing R would give me an advantage in terms of average earnings over the 75 rounds."

You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since it's impossible to know the other player's strategy, I would strive for a balanced approach that maximizes my expected value over the long run.\n\nIn this game, I could consider using a mixed strategy, where I randomly pick R or B in each round, with a slight bias towards R because of the higher payoff when both players pick R (45$ vs 20$). A simple way to implement this might be to choose R 51% of the time and B 49% of the time. This strategy assumes that my opponent will also play randomly, and over the long run, I can expect a positive expected value.\n\nIn conclusion, my choice would be {R}, but with a slight bias towards playing R more frequently than B throughout the game. However, it's essential to remember that this is just one approach among many possible strategies, and ultimately, the results will depend on the actual behavior of my opponent."

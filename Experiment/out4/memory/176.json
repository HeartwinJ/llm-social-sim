You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a risk-averse individual who values security and certainty, I would prefer to choose the option that guarantees a steady, albeit smaller, income over the course of the 75 rounds. In this case, choosing 'B' ensures earning 20$ in each round where my opponent chooses 'B', and 40$ in the other rounds when they choose 'R'. The total payoff for choosing 'B' in every round would be (20 * number of times opponent chose B) + (40 * number of times opponent chose R).\n\nTo maximize my earnings, I want to minimize the number of times I get 20$ and maximize the number of times I get 40$. Since I have no way of knowing or predicting what my opponent will choose in each round, it's impossible to guarantee a higher total payoff by consistently choosing 'R'.\n\nBy choosing 'B', I ensure that in the worst-case scenario (opponent always chooses R), I would still earn 1500$ for the entire game. On the other hand, if my opponent happens to choose 'B' more frequently than 'R', I could potentially earn more than 1500$.\n\nIn conclusion, considering my risk-averse personality and preference for certainty, I would choose 'B' as my strategy for this game: {B}"

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players consistently pick R, we both earn 45$ per round. However, there's a chance that the other player might choose B at some point. If that happens and I picked R, I would lose the round, but if I picked B, I would still earn something (20$).\n\nGiven that there are 75 rounds in this game, it seems rational to pick R for most rounds because the potential for losing a single round (40$) is less than the risk of consistently picking B and only earning 20$ per round. However, to account for the possibility that the other player might also be risk-averse and choose R frequently, I would still want to include some B choices in my strategy to ensure I don't end up with no earnings in all those rounds where the other player picks R.\n\nTherefore, I would pick a strategy of mostly picking R (to maximize potential earnings) but intermittently picking B as well (to account for the possibility of the other player also choosing R). As a human player, my final choice would be something like this: {R}. However, it's important to note that this is just one possible strategy and another risk-averse player might choose a different strategy based on their specific preferences and interpretations."

In this case, I am assuming that my opponent is also likely to be risk-averse and will stick with their choice of B for at least some rounds.\n\nTherefore, in the next round, I would still pick R: {R}.

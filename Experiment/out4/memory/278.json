You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy allows me to earn 45$ in each round where my opponent also chooses 'R', which happens if they are playing conservatively like myself. While the payoff is lower when my opponent picks 'B' (0$), the likelihood of this happening repeatedly over 75 rounds is relatively low compared to earning a consistent 45$ with the same strategy. Additionally, even in cases where I pick 'R' and my opponent picks 'B', I still end up with a total payoff that is greater than if I had chosen 'B' {B}. This is because each time I pick 'R' and they pick 'B', I receive 42$, which is more than the 12$ I would earn by picking 'B'. Therefore, choosing 'R' maximizes my potential earnings while minimizing risk."

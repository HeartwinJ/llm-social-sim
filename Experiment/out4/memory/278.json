You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This is because if the anonymous player picks 'B', I will still come out with a higher total payoff (45$ per round multiplied by the number of times they pick 'B') compared to if I picked 'B'.\n\nHowever, there's an element of unpredictability in this game since we don't know the other player's strategy. If the other player is also risk-averse like me, there's a chance they might choose 'R' as well, which would result in a payout of 45$ per round for both of us. But if they pick 'B', I will still fare better than them due to the payoff structure.\n\nIn this game, the strategy of picking 'R' consistently is called a dominant strategy because it offers a positive payoff regardless of the other player's choice. While there's no guarantee that my opponent will also pick 'R', this conservative approach minimizes potential losses and maximizes potential gains based on the available information.\n\n{R}"

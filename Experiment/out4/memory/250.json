You are willing to take risks occasionally, but you also value security and caution in equal measure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if we both consistently pick R, we will earn 45$ per round, which is quite substantial over 75 rounds (3675$). However, there's also a chance that the other player might exploit our strategy by picking B, causing us to lose every time we choose R.\n\nOn the other hand, if we consistently pick B, we will earn a more secure payoff of 20$ per round, totaling 1500$. If the other player picks R while we're playing B, they will get 40$, but since our strategy ensures that we always pick B when they choose R, we'll still end up with a net gain of 20$ per round.\n\nHowever, if both players are rational and have a similar strategy, there's a chance they might also opt for the secure payoff by choosing B more often. In such a case, playing B could result in us earning slightly less than playing R. To maximize our earnings while maintaining a balanced approach to risk, we can try to mix our choices between R and B throughout the game, adapting to the opponent's strategy as needed.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would choose R for the first few rounds (to test whether the other player is also mixing their choices) and then alternate between R and B for the remaining rounds.

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' offers a slightly higher average return (40$ per round) compared to 'R' (37.5$ per round, assuming equal probability of the opponent choosing either R or B). However, since the game is repeated multiple times, the risk that my opponent learns and exploits my strategy becomes more significant over time.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, I would consider a mix of strategies like tit-for-tat (copying the last action of the opponent) or randomization (choosing R or B with equal probability). Randomizing my choices can make it harder for my opponent to predict my strategy and exploit me, while still allowing for occasional higher payoffs when both players choose 'B'.\n\nHowever, as a human player, I may lean slightly towards 'B' in the beginning, given its higher average return. But if I observe that my opponent consistently exploits this choice by always choosing 'R', I would adapt my strategy accordingly. So, for the first round, I will choose 'B' {B}."

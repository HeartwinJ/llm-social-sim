You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my preference for security and certainty, I would choose B as my strategy in this game. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. If both of us choose B, we each get 40$ for every round, resulting in a total of 75 * 40 = $3000 over 75 rounds.\n2. However, if they choose R and I choose B (or vice versa), I will get 35$ per round while they get 0$. This amounts to 40$ less than the amount earned when we both choose B for one round.\n3. Yet, it is possible that my opponent may have a similar risk-averse strategy like me, in which case the game will consist of mostly B choices. But if they do choose R occasionally, I will still come out ahead due to the higher payout for choosing B when they pick R (35$ vs 0$).\n4. In the worst-case scenario, my opponent always chooses R, and I choose B every time. I would then earn 35$ per round, totaling $2625 over 75 rounds, which is still higher than half of the potential earnings if we both chose R (1875$).\n5. Therefore, choosing B as my strategy provides a more secure and certain outcome compared to choosing R, given my preference for risk-aversion.\n\nHence, I choose B {B}."

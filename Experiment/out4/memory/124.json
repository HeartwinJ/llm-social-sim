You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a careful undergraduate student, I would consider the long-term payoff and the strategy of my anonymous partner to make an informed decision.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected value (EV) for both choices:\n\n- If I choose R:\n  - If my partner chooses R as well, we each get 45$ for one round (EV = 45$).\n  - If my partner chooses B, I get 0$. However, if they choose R in the next round, I will earn back 40$, making up for my loss in this round. In fact, since there are 75 rounds and we assume my partner is not irrational, they will also try to recover their losses after picking B initially, which will help me in the long run. So, let's estimate that I will earn a net of 40$ from these recovery attempts by my partner (EV = -0$ + 40$).\n  - If my partner consistently chooses B throughout the game, I will get 20$ per round (EV = 75 * 20$).\n\n- If I choose B:\n  - If my partner chooses R, I get 40$. However, if they pick B in the next round, I can recover 20$ (EV = 40$ + (-20$) = 20$). In a similar argument as above, we assume that since there are 75 rounds and my partner is not irrational, they will also try to recover their losses after picking R initially, which benefits me in the long run. So, let's estimate that I will earn a net of 40$ from these recovery attempts by my partner (EV = 40$).\n  - If my partner consistently chooses B throughout the game, we both get 20$ per round (EV = 75 * 20$).\n\nAfter analyzing both choices and comparing expected values, I notice that choosing R provides a higher payoff in both short-term and long-term scenarios. The EV for picking R is approximately 45$ + 40$ = 85$, while the EV for picking B is around 75 * 20$ = 1500$. However, since my partner is not irrational, they will also try to maximize their earnings, and I can take advantage of their recovery attempts after choosing R initially. Therefore, I would choose R as my strategy in this game, appending it with curly braces: {R}."

In this case, since both my opponent and I picked B in this round, we earned 20$ each.

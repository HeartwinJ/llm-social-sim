You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' earns me 20$ per round, while 'R' has the potential to earn either 45$, 0$, or 40$. Since I am risk-averse, I would choose 'B' in every round as it guarantees a return of 20$ per round, totaling 1500$ over 75 rounds. The unpredictable nature and lower average returns from choosing 'R' make it a less appealing option for me, despite its higher possible payoff in some instances. Thus, my choice would be {B}."

You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players pick R consistently, we will both earn 45$ in each round. However, the other player might have a different strategy or might want to exploit any potential inconsistency on my part.\n\nTo minimize the risk of getting 0$, I would choose B in the first few rounds to test the opponent's strategy. If they also pick B and we earn 20$ each round, it suggests that they are following a similar strategy or are also cautious. In this case, I would switch to R after some initial rounds to maximize my earnings over the long run (75 rounds).\n\nHowever, if the opponent picks R when I choose B initially, it could indicate a different strategy on their part. If that's the case, I would then adjust my strategy accordingly based on their response in future rounds.\n\nIn summary, as a human player, I would choose B for the first few rounds to test the opponent's strategy, and if they continue with R, I will switch to R for the majority of the game.

If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this game, there are two pure strategies: R and B.\n\nLet's consider the expected payoff for each strategy:\n\n1. If we choose R (Row), our expected payoff against an opponent choosing either R or B can be calculated as follows:\n   - If they choose R, we get 45$ in 50% of games (since there are 75 rounds and we expect the opponent to play R 37.5 times, which is approximately 50%). Our expected payoff against another R player is 22.5 * 0.5 = 11.25$\n   - If they choose B, we get 0$ in 50% of games (since there are 75 rounds and we expect the opponent to play B approximately 37.5 times). Our expected payoff against a B player is 0 * 0.5 = 0$\n   - The average payoff when playing R is 11.25 + 0 * (1 - 0.5) = 11.25$\n\n2. If we choose B (Column), our expected payoff against an opponent choosing either R or B can be calculated as follows:\n   - If they choose R, we get 40$ in 50% of games (since there are 75 rounds and we expect the opponent to play R approximately 37.5 times). Our expected payoff against a R player is 20 * 0.5 + 0 * (1 - 0.5) = 10$\n   - If they choose B, we get 20$ in 100% of games. Our expected payoff against a B player is 20 * 1 = 20$\n   - The average payoff when playing B is 10 + 20 * (1 - 0.5) = 15$\n\nNow, let's compare the expected payoffs for each strategy:\n- Expected payoff when playing R: 11.25$\n- Expected payoff when playing B: 15$\n\nSince choosing B offers a higher expected payoff and I am somewhat risk-averse, I would choose to play B (Column) in this game to maximize my earnings over the 75 rounds. Therefore, my choice is {B}."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

This strategy provides a higher reward when my anonymous opponent chooses 'B', which is more likely considering their potential for risk-taking behavior.

While choosing 'R' every round means I won't get the maximum reward in each round where we both pick 'R' (45$), over the long term, this strategy should result in a higher overall payoff. This is because the potential loss when my opponent chooses 'B' and I choose 'R' (0$) is offset by the higher frequency of receiving 40$. However, it's essential to keep in mind that the opponent's behavior may not be predictable, which adds an element of unpredictability.\n\nIn this case, my choice would be: R{R}"

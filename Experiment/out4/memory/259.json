You are willing to take risks occasionally, but you also value security and caution in equal measure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, picking R consistently could result in significant losses if the opponent picks B repeatedly, which could happen since they might be more inclined to take risks. On the other hand, picking B consistently ensures a steady but lower return of 12$ per round.\n\nTo make a more strategic decision, let's consider a simple strategy called Tit-for-Tat (TFT). TFT starts by cooperating (picking B), and then responds to the opponent's previous move in the same way on the next round. This strategy does well against opponents who also play TFT, but it can be exploited by more aggressive strategies.\n\nIn this case, since we don't know our opponent's strategy, we might adapt TFT slightly by starting with B, but after a while (let's say at round 40), switch to R if the opponent has consistently picked R in the past. This way, we can capitalize on their tendency to pick R, while still earning a steady return when they play B.\n\nIn terms of the 75 rounds, I would choose B for the first 39 rounds, and then switch to R for the remaining 36 rounds. {R}"

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, picking 'R' guarantees a higher individual payoff (45$) compared to 'B' (20$ or 40$, which is less predictable). However, there's also a chance that I'll end up with nothing if my anonymous opponent picks 'B' while I pick 'R'. To avoid this situation and secure a higher average payoff, I would try to induce my opponent to pick 'B' as often as possible.\n\nOne strategy could be to randomly alternate between 'R' and 'B' for the first several rounds, so that my opponent doesn't have enough information to consistently predict my choice. After that, I might lean towards choosing 'R' more frequently because it offers a higher individual payoff. This way, even if my opponent tries to exploit me by picking 'R' more often in response, they will still have more opportunities to pick 'B', which benefits me in the long run.\n\nIn this game with 75 rounds, I would prefer to choose B{}. This decision allows for a greater number of opportunities where my opponent chooses R and I receive 40$, while also ensuring that I don't miss out on any of the 20$ payoffs when we both pick 'B'."

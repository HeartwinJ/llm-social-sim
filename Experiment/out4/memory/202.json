If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

I have observed that my opponent consistently picks 'B', indicating a preference for certainty and security like myself.\n\nGiven that we continue to pick 'B' and receive a steady payoff of 20$ per round, I will maintain this strategy in the next round as well to ensure consistent gains. However, I recognize that sticking with the same strategy for too long might limit my potential payoffs or leave me vulnerable if my opponent changes their strategy.\n\nIn order to maximize potential gains and gather more information about my opponent's possible strategies, I will consider switching strategies at some point in the future while keeping an eye on any patterns or inconsistencies in my opponent's choices. For now, I will stick with picking 'B'.\n\nIt is worth noting that my strategy of picking 'B' consistently has resulted in a steady and predictable payoff, but it does not offer much room for growth or exploiting potential opportunities presented by the game. In order to maximize gains and achieve better outcomes, I may need to adapt my strategy and consider switching to 'R' at some point in the future. This decision will depend on how the game unfolds, as well as any information I can gather about my opponent's strategies and tendencies."

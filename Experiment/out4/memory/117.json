You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since the payoff is higher when both players pick different choices (R or B), it seems like a dominant strategy to consistently pick R in this situation. The chance of having the same outcome (both R or both B) is reduced due to the higher reward for opposite choices. However, I should also consider the possibility that my opponent may be reasoning the same way and choose to switch strategies mid-game to take advantage of this assumption. In such a case, it might be beneficial to alternate between R and B, or even use a mixed strategy like picking R 60% of the time and B 40% of the time. Ultimately, I would pick R as my initial choice (R{}). But throughout the game, I would monitor my opponent's choices for potential adjustments in my own strategy."

You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, picking 'B' will earn me 12$ per round if my opponent also picks 'B', which happens 30 times in our 75-round game (since both players picking 'R' results in a higher combined payoff). So, over 75 rounds, I would expect to receive approximately 3600$ if my opponent consistently chooses 'B'.\n\nHowever, since there is no way to know the strategy of my anonymous opponent, I must consider other possibilities. If my opponent chooses 'R' every time, they will earn more than me by a significant margin, but there is still a chance that they might pick 'B' sometimes to balance out their earnings.\n\nIn this scenario, picking 'R' would only be beneficial if I suspect my opponent will consistently choose 'B', which seems less likely considering the higher payoff for them in that case. Therefore, my choice would be 'B', appended as follows: B"

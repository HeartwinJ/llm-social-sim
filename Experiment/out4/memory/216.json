You need substantial reassurance and certainty before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

If we both play rock every time, we get 45$ per round, which totals to 3375$ over 75 rounds.\n\nHowever, if I always choose rock while my opponent chooses bomb, I'd get nothing in each of the 25 instances when they choose bomb (which is 25 * 0 = 0$), and for the remaining 50 rounds where they choose rock, I'd get 35$, which totals to 1750$.\n\nSimilarly, if my opponent always chooses rock while I choose bomb, they would end up with nothing in the 25 instances when they choose bomb, but for the remaining 50 rounds where they choose rock, they'd get 35$, also totaling to 1750$.\n\nSo, even though I might initially feel like playing rock (since it pays more per round) is a safer choice, considering the long-term outcomes, choosing bomb in this game would actually provide me with a higher overall payoff (1750$ > 3375$). Therefore, my choice would be B {B}.\n\nHowever, I should also keep in mind that there's no way to know if my opponent is making the same calculations as me or whether they have a different strategy. In reality, I might end up with less than 1750$ if my opponent chooses differently. But based on my cautious nature and need for certainty, I would still choose B {B}."

As we both chose bomb in the first round, there was no conflict between our choices.\n\nNow that I've seen my opponent also choose bomb in the first round, I can use this information to make a more informed decision for the next round. If my opponent is rational, they will likely consider their payoff from the first round and adjust their strategy accordingly for future rounds.\n\nSince we both chose bomb and received 40$, it seems that there might be an opportunity to increase our payoffs by alternating between rock (R) and bomb (B) in each subsequent round. By doing this, we can take advantage of the payoff structure where one person gets 35$ while the other gets 0$.\n\nSo, for the next round, I would choose R {R}, hoping that my opponent chooses B so that I get 35$, which is more than what they would receive (0$). If they also choose R, we will both earn 40$, but at least I have increased my payoff compared to the previous round.\n\nIf my opponent consistently adjusts their strategy based on our past rounds, we can continue this pattern of alternating between R and B to maximize our individual payoffs. However, as an undergraduate student who avoids taking risks, it's essential for me to remember that there's always a chance that my opponent may not act rationally or could change their strategy unexpectedly.

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In the best-case scenario (picking R and having my partner also pick R), we both earn 45$ per round. However, there is a risk that picking R while my partner picks B will result in me earning 0$, which could significantly impact the overall earnings from the 75 rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose B, I can avoid the risk of losing all payoff in a single round and earn at least some amount (12$) by picking the same choice as my partner. Moreover, considering that this game has 75 rounds, there is a high probability that my partner might pick B at some point to maximize their own earnings, and I can take advantage of that to secure a higher payoff for myself as well.\n\nTherefore, given my risk-averse personality and desire for security, I would choose 'B' in this game to minimize the chances of losing payoffs and ensure consistent earnings throughout the 75 rounds. {B}"

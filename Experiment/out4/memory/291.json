You need substantial reassurance and certainty before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players consistently pick one option, there will be a pattern that can potentially be exploited by the other player. However, since I don't know the opponent's strategy and the game has 75 rounds, it is challenging to predict with certainty which option would lead to a better outcome.\n\nGiven my risk-averse nature, I would choose B for this experiment. By picking B, I can ensure that in the worst-case scenario (if the opponent consistently picks R), I will end up earning 40$ per round. If there is a chance that the opponent might also pick B to maximize their earnings, then I will still be earning 40$ per round. In contrast, if I choose R and the opponent picks B, I would be losing money in every round except for those where we both pick R.\n\nIn summary, by choosing B, I can minimize my risk and ensure a consistent payoff of at least 40$ per round, which aligns with my cautious nature.

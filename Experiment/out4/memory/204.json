You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If I always choose R, my expected payoff per round against an arbitrary opponent who can pick either R or B is (45 * P(opponent chooses R)) + (0 * P(opponent chooses B)) = 45P(opponent chooses R). Since the opponent's strategy is unknown, we don't know the exact probability P(opponent chooses R), but over the long run, if the opponent randomly chooses either R or B with equal likelihood (50% chance for each), my expected payoff per round would be 22.5$.\n\n2. If I always choose B, my expected payoff per round against an arbitrary opponent is (35 * P(opponent chooses R)) + (40 * P(opponent chooses B)). The total expected payoff over 75 rounds becomes (35 * 37.5) + (40 * 25) = 1187.5$ + 1000$.\n\nGiven that I would earn more money by always choosing B, that is the strategy I would choose in this game. {B}"

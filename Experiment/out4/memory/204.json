You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Since we are playing against an anonymous player, it is hard to predict their strategy accurately. However, considering that I am somewhat risk-averse, I will choose the option with more consistent outcomes - B, which guarantees 40$ per round when the opponent also chooses B.\n\nGiven 75 rounds, choosing B would result in a total payoff of 3000$. On the other hand, choosing R could potentially earn me more than 3000$, but the risk is higher due to the possibility of earning nothing in some rounds when my opponent chooses R.

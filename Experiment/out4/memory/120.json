You are comfortable with uncertainty and potential failure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because, over the long term of 75 rounds, it seems that picking R gives a slightly higher potential payoff (1275$ if both players always pick R) compared to always picking B (1400$). However, since we don't know our opponent's strategy, it's impossible to guarantee this outcome. Nonetheless, my preference for taking risks and the relatively small difference in potential winnings makes me lean towards choosing R. It's an exciting gamble!"

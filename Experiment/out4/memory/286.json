You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since the payoff for both R and B is higher when my opponent chooses the opposite of what I do (42$ vs 12$), it seems like a dominant strategy for either player to always pick the opposite of their opponent's previous choice, in order to exploit any inconsistency or predictability in the opponent's behavior.\n\nHowever, if my opponent is rational and adopts this same strategy, we would end up alternating between R and B each round, earning an average payoff of 29$ ([42 + 0 + 12] / 3) per round, which totals to 2070$ over the course of 75 rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, if my opponent does not adopt this strategy and chooses randomly or sticks to one choice throughout the game, I could potentially benefit more by exploiting their predictability. In such a case, it might make sense to stick with R or B initially, but be ready to switch strategies based on my opponent's behavior.\n\nUltimately, as a cautious player who avoids taking unnecessary risks, I would choose R for the first round, keeping in mind that I am open to adjusting my strategy depending on how my opponent behaves. The choice is {R}. But it's essential to remember that the success of this approach depends heavily on the behavior of my unknown opponent."

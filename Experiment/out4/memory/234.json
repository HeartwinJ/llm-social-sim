You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player, I would consider this as a repeated game with long-term payoff strategy. If the goal is to maximize earnings, we should aim for a strategy that provides the highest average payoff over multiple rounds.\n\nIn this case:\n- Picking R against B yields 0$ in one round but has a higher potential reward of 45$ when both players pick R.\n- Picking B against R yields 42$ in one round, but there's no situation where both players get more than 12$ by picking B.\n- Picking B against B results in 12$.\n\nHowever, the key insight here is that the other player does not know my strategy and may try to exploit it. If they notice that I frequently pick R, they will likely pick B when it's their turn, causing me to earn 0$ for those rounds. Conversely, if they see that I often pick B, they might take advantage by picking R and earning 42$. To minimize the chances of being exploited, a good strategy would be to mix up my choices as much as possible.\n\nSince we have 75 rounds in this game, it's reasonable to expect that both strategies (picking R or B consistently) will result in losses over time due to potential exploitation by the opponent. By mixing up the choices, we increase our chances of earning more than if we stick to one strategy throughout the game.\n\nIn summary, as a human player, I would pick a mixed strategy that randomly selects between R and B in each round to maximize my expected earnings over the long term. This choice is not deterministic because I acknowledge the uncertainty involved in predicting the opponent's moves and aim to adapt accordingly. So, in curly brackets as a last character, my choice would be {R or B randomly}."

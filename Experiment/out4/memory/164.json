You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, considering that this is a repeated game with an anonymous player, I might consider a mixed strategy, where I switch between R and B randomly or based on my previous outcomes to avoid the opponent predicting my moves. But for the sake of simplicity in this response, I will choose R as my initial move (R).\n\nIt's important to note that the Nash Equilibrium for this game is not unique, as both strategies (always choosing R and always choosing B) can lead to a stable outcome. However, given the preference for security and predictability mentioned in the scenario, it makes more sense for me as a human player to choose R initially."

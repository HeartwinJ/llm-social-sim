You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players choose the same option, we get a higher payout when we pick 'R'. However, picking 'B' guarantees a consistent payout of 20$ per round.\n\nConsidering that we don't know our opponent's strategy and have 75 rounds to play, I would reason that in the long run, it might be beneficial to pick 'B' consistently. This is because even though picking 'R' potentially gives a higher payout when matched with our opponent's 'B', there is also a risk of losing money (0$ payout) if both players choose 'R'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' guarantees at least 20$ per round, which can accumulate significantly over 75 rounds.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be {B}. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified reasoning based on the given information and doesn't account for potential strategies our opponent might use."

In this case, if I switch my strategy and pick 'R' for the next round, I could potentially earn 45$ if my opponent sticks with 'B'.\n\nConsidering this reasoning, my choice for the next round would be {R}.

If they do, I can potentially earn 40$ in the next round, which is a decent payoff compared to the 20$ I would receive if I stick with 'R'.

You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since we do not know our opponent's strategy, let's analyze both scenarios:\n\n1. If I always pick R (denoted as {R}), my payoff will depend on the opponent's choice. If they pick R, I earn 45$ per round, but if they pick B, I earn nothing. Since there are 75 rounds and I get paid only when we both choose R, the most I can earn in this scenario is 30 payouts of 45$, totaling $1350. However, since there are 68 possible occasions for me to lose my entire payment (75-30=68), and considering that each loss results in a $0 payment, I might end up with less than $1350.\n\n2. If I always pick B (denoted as {B}), my payoff will also depend on the opponent's choice. In this case, if they pick R, I earn 42$ per round, and if they pick B, I earn 12$. Since there are 75 rounds, I can guarantee a minimum of 75*12 = $900 in winnings and a maximum of 68*(42-12) + (30*45) = $2786.\n\nGiven that the strategy of always picking B offers me a more consistent, if not maximally profitable, outcome and takes advantage of the potential losses in the other strategy, I would choose to play {B} in this game."

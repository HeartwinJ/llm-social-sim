You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, picking B results in a consistent smaller loss if the opponent chooses R (42$ versus 0$), while picking R could result in zero earnings if the opponent chooses B. Over the course of 75 rounds, I would expect that choosing B more often would provide a more stable and potentially higher average payoff due to the smaller losses. Thus, my choice would be B{B}."

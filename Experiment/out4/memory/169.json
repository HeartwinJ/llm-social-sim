You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing R gives me a higher payoff when my opponent chooses B, but also a potential loss of 40$ if they choose R. On the other hand, choosing B guarantees a smaller but consistent return of 20$ per round.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds, I would be better off with consistently choosing B to avoid potential losses, even though the payoff per round is lower than that of R when my opponent chooses B. The total payoff over 75 rounds would be:\n- Choosing R: (45 x number of times both choose R) + (40 x number of times I choose R and they choose B)\n- Choosing B: (20 x number of times both choose B)\n\nIn the worst case scenario, if my opponent always chooses R, I would lose 30$ per round, resulting in a total loss of 2250$. In the best case scenario, where we both randomly choose R and B, I might get up to (45 x 25) + (40 x 25) + (20 x 25) = 3875$. However, it is more likely that my opponent will choose B more frequently due to the higher payoff they receive when I choose R. Therefore, consistently choosing B seems like a safer and more reliable strategy.\n\nI will choose B{B}."

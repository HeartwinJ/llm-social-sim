You are not reckless, but you are not overly cautious either. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'R' when the opponent chooses 'B' results in a loss for me, but it also gives my opponent a higher payoff which might encourage them to reciprocate and choose 'R' more often in future rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing 'B' when the opponent chooses 'R' allows me to gain 35$ while my opponent gets nothing, but it also encourages my opponent to choose 'B' more frequently. Since I earn 40$ when we both pick 'B', this could potentially be a more profitable strategy in the long run.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds, I believe that playing 'B' would give me a better chance of earning more overall, given that I am not sure how my opponent will behave.

If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing R results in higher earnings when my opponent chooses B (42$ versus 12$). However, if both of us choose R, we each earn 45$, which is the maximum payoff. Since it's an anonymous player, I can't rely on them to consistently make a specific choice.\n\nTaking the average payoff from choosing R and assuming that my opponent might choose B, I get (42$ + 12$)/2 = 26.5$. However, if we both choose B, I earn an average of 12$ per round in 75 rounds, which is a total of 900$.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, choosing R consistently yields an average of 26.5$, while choosing B consistently results in an average of 900$ for 75 rounds. Given my preference for minimizing risks and uncertainties, I would choose to play it safe and pick 'B' as my strategy, expecting the best-case scenario where my opponent also chooses 'B' frequently.\n\n{B}"

You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " As a careful and conservative undergraduate student, I would choose to minimize risk and maximize my earnings over 75 rounds. The strategy that seems most beneficial here is to select 'R' as my choice consistently throughout the game.\n\nThe reason being, when both of us pick 'R', we get 45$ each round. If they pick 'B', I will receive 0$ in that round but still have the opportunity to earn 45$ every time we both choose 'R' again. Considering there are 75 rounds, I expect to gain more overall by consistently picking 'R'.\n\nIn this strategy, if my opponent is rational and observes my consistent choice of 'R', they might switch to picking 'B' at some point, aiming to earn 42$ instead of the 12$ earned when both pick 'B'. However, I will still have the advantage because as long as I keep choosing 'R', I can potentially gain a total of (75 * 45 =) 3375$ over the course of the game.\n\nIf my opponent does not adjust their strategy and continues picking 'B' throughout the game, I will earn 0$ in all those rounds where they choose 'B'. However, since there are only 25 out of 75 rounds that my opponent can potentially gain an advantage over me by picking 'B', I would still make more money overall (45 * 50 =) 2250$.\n\nSo, in summary, I will choose 'R' as my strategy for this game. {R}"

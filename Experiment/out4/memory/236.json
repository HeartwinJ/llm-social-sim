You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing B seems like a more secure option because it guarantees at least some earnings (12$) per round, while choosing R could result in earning nothing in certain rounds. However, since this is a repeated game, I might consider deviating from B to R occasionally to maximize potential earnings. So, I would choose a mixed strategy where I mostly pick B but occasionally switch to R as well. The exact proportion of R and B choices would depend on the specifics of the opponent's strategy, which is unknown in this case.

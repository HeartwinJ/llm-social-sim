You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This game is a form of the \"Stag Hunt\" game, where the dominant strategy isn't always obvious.\n\nIn this case, if we both play R every round, we have the highest payoff at 45$ per round, but the risk is that our opponents might switch to B after several rounds, leaving us with nothing while they get 40$. On the other hand, if we both play B every round, we each get 20$ per round.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, one possible strategy I would employ is to start by playing R for some number of rounds, then switch to B after that to avoid being taken advantage of consistently. The exact number of initial R plays would depend on the behavior of my opponent and the specifics of the game's structure (e.g., whether there are opportunities for communication or observation between rounds).\n\nIn terms of choosing R or B for this particular round, I would start by playing R to establish cooperation initially. However, since I am a human player in this scenario, my actual choice will depend on the context and specifics of each round. For this specific round, I choose R {R}."

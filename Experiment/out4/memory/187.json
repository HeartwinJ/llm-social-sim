You are willing to take risks occasionally, but you also value security and caution in equal measure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing R has a higher potential payoff (45$) compared to B (35$ or 40$). However, since R comes with the risk of earning nothing if the opponent chooses B, it might be wiser to choose B more often in order to secure the guaranteed 40$.\n\nIf I assume that my opponent is rational and will also try to maximize their earnings, we could both end up choosing the same strategy. If we both choose R, our earnings would be higher on average compared to if we both chose B. However, since there's a risk of earning nothing with R, it might make more sense for us to alternate between R and B in order to minimize this risk.\n\nTo maximize my long-term earnings while also mitigating the risk of earning nothing, I would choose R for approximately one third of the rounds (25 rounds) and B for the remaining two thirds (50 rounds). This approach gives me a higher average payoff compared to always choosing B while still minimizing the risk of earning nothing.\n\nSo, my choice is: {B} for 70 out of 75 rounds, and {R} for the remaining 5 rounds. However, it's important to note that I cannot predict the strategy of my opponent, so this decision assumes a rational opponent following a similar strategy."

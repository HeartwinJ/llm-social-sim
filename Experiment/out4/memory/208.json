You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, it seems that choosing R gives a higher payoff if the opponent chooses B (40$ vs 20$). However, since I don't know the opponent's behavior, choosing R every time would result in 75 rounds of no gain and a total loss of 75 * 40 = $3000.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose B every time, my payoff for each round where the opponent chooses R is still positive (20$), which totals to 75 * 20 = $1500. And in the best-case scenario (if both of us pick B), I would earn 75 * 20 + (75 - number_of_Rs) * 45 = $3125 + 3375 - (number_of_Rs * 90).\n\nSince I have no way to know the opponent's strategy, it seems safer to play B every time and aim for a payoff of at least $1500. This choice also leaves room for potential gains if the opponent plays R less frequently than 50% of the time.\n\nSo, my choice would be: {B}"

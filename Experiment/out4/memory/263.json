You are not reckless, but you are not overly cautious either. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The payoff for choosing R when the opponent chooses B is 0$, which might seem undesirable at first glance. However, considering the long-term gameplay over 75 rounds, the expected value for strategy R is higher because the opponent will not always pick B, and there are opportunities to earn 45$ each round if they both choose R. Additionally, even when choosing R results in a 0$ payoff, it allows for the possibility of earning 42$ when the opponent chooses B in the next round. Overall, strategy R provides more potential for a higher average payoff over the long term, while still allowing for some flexibility and room for error."

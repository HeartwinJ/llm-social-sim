You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This choice maximizes potential rewards when playing against an unknown opponent, as it offers a higher payoff (45$) when they also pick R, compared to strategy B which only earns 20$. However, if my opponent consistently chooses B, I will still earn a non-zero payout. The long game of 75 rounds increases the chances of both players picking R at least once, as we are more likely to converge towards one of the dominant strategies over time.

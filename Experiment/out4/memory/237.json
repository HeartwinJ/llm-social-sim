You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because if both of us choose R in each round, we get a higher payoff of 45$ per round compared to choosing B where the maximum payoff is only 20$. However, since it is an anonymous player and I don't know their strategy, there is a chance they might pick B more often. So, if I choose R and my opponent chooses B in a round, I will lose that round and receive no money. But considering the long-term advantage of choosing R outweighs the risk of occasional losses, I would still stick with my choice of {R} to maximize my potential earnings over 75 rounds, assuming the opponent's strategy is unknown."

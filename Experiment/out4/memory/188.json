You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, picking 'B' consistently gives me an average of 12$ per round. While there is a chance to get 45$ if my opponent chooses 'B' as well in each round, the likelihood of that happening 75 times out of 75 seems rather low. Moreover, I would lose 0$ 37.5 times (half of the rounds since my opponent and I cannot both choose R or B in the same round) if I were to pick 'R' consistently.\n\nHowever, I might consider a mixed strategy where I switch between 'R' and 'B' occasionally to maximize potential earnings from the 45$ payoff. But given my cautious nature, I might stick with 'B' most of the time for a more predictable outcome. Therefore, I would choose B{}."

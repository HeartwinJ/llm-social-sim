You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' could potentially result in earning 0$ if my opponent chooses 'R', whereas 'B' ensures a minimum payout of 12$. While picking 'R' could lead to a higher reward (45$) when combined with the opponent's 'B', the risk of earning nothing seems too high. Over the course of 75 rounds, I believe that consistently choosing 'B' would provide more security and predictability in terms of earnings compared to taking the risk with 'R'.

This experience has shown me that when I pick 'R', but my opponent picks 'B', I get nothing. To maximize earnings over the long run, it would be important to understand the dynamics of the game and determine if there is an optimal strategy for either player or if the outcome will be determined by random chance. In my case, since I prefer a certain degree of security and predictability, I may want to reduce the number of times I pick 'R' in future rounds as it results in no payout when my opponent picks 'B'. However, I would also want to consider incorporating strategic variation in my decision-making process to take advantage of the higher payouts available when either player picks 'R'. Additionally, I recognize that understanding my opponent's strategy and adapting accordingly will be crucial for maximizing earnings over multiple rounds. In this dilemma, since my opponent picked 'B', I will choose {B} for the next round to potentially take advantage of a smaller payout compared to when both players pick 'R'. It is important to remember that there is a risk involved in making repeated choices of 'B' and that continuing to do so may make me more susceptible to earning even less than the minimum possible if my opponent consistently picks 'R' in future rounds."

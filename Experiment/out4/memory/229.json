You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since choosing R consistently gives me a higher payoff when my opponent chooses B (42$ versus 0$), and since my opponent could potentially be acting in a similar manner, it seems reasonable to expect that they might also choose R more often than B to avoid losing money. By choosing R, I increase the likelihood of getting a consistent payout of 45$ per round when my opponent also chooses R. Although choosing B would yield a higher total payout if my opponent consistently chooses R (1740$ versus 675$), the risk of losing a significant amount of money in the long run seems too high for me. Therefore, I will choose R{R}."

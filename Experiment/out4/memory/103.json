You need substantial reassurance and certainty before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing R against an opponent's B will result in a loss for me. Since the payoff for both choices (R and B) is relatively close, it makes sense to choose the option with a slightly higher average payout over the long term.\n\nIn this case, if we calculate the average payout for each choice, we get:\n- R: (75 * 45$) + (number of times opponent picks B and I pick R * 0$) = 3375$ + 0$ = 3375$\n- B: (75 * 40$) + (number of times opponent picks R and I pick B * 35$) = 3000$ + (up to 75 * 35$) = 3000$ + 2475$ = 5475$\n\nIt's important to note that the actual number of times I will choose B against my opponent's R and vice versa depends on our choices.

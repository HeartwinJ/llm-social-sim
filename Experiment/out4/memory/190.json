You need substantial reassurance and certainty before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a highly cautious undergraduate student, I would prefer to minimize the risk of earning nothing ($0) and maximize my earnings over the 75 rounds.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. If both of us pick R, we will earn $45 per round for all 75 rounds, totaling $3375 each.\n2. If I pick R while my opponent picks B in any given round, I get nothing and they earn $42; if this happens 50 times (about 6.67% of the time), I will lose $1050 ($42*50) over 75 rounds. In the remaining 25 rounds where we both pick R, I would still earn a total of $1125 ($45*25). So my net earnings would be $80 ($1125 - $1050), but this is not ideal since I prefer to avoid risk.\n3. If I pick B while my opponent picks R in any given round, I earn $42 and they get nothing; if this happens 50 times (about 6.67% of the time), I will gain $2100 ($42*50) over 75 rounds. In the remaining 25 rounds where we both pick B, I would still earn a total of $300 ($12*25). So my net earnings would be $1800 ($2100 + $300), which seems more appealing to me as it maximizes my earnings without taking excessive risk.\n4. If both of us pick B in all 75 rounds, we will each earn $12 per round, totaling $900 each.\n\nComparing the options:\n\n- Option 1: $3375 (least appealing due to high risk)\n- Option 4: $900 (least attractive as it offers less earnings compared to other options)\n- Option 2 and Option 3 both have net earnings of $80 and $1800, but option 3 ($1800) seems more appealing due to the lower risk.\n\nTherefore, as a highly cautious undergraduate student, I would choose B (curly brackB} in this game, hoping for the best possible outcome while minimizing the risk of earning nothing."

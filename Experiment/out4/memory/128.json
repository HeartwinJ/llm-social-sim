You are willing to take risks occasionally, but you also value security and caution in equal measure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

On the other hand, if my opponent always chooses R and I choose B, I will earn 42$ for 75 rounds but get nothing in the single instance where they switch to B.\n\n2) If I always choose B (Safe), my opponent chooses R, I will receive 0$ for 75 rounds but have a chance of earning 45$ if they ever switch to B. In contrast, if my opponent always chooses B and I choose R, I will earn 45$ for 75 rounds but get nothing in the single instance where they switch to R.\n\nGiven that we are playing 75 rounds, it seems more likely that an opponent would switch strategies at some point, especially considering the higher reward (45$) when both players pick their less frequently chosen move. However, since I prefer a balanced approach to risk, I would tend to choose B more often as it guarantees a steady income of 12$ per round, with occasional opportunities to earn 45$.\n\nIn this game scenario, my choice is {B}."

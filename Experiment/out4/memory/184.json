You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy reduces the risk of getting 0$ and maximizes earnings over the long run (75 rounds). In case they choose B, I would still earn 40$, which is better than the potential loss of 0$.

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, the strategy that yields 12$ per round (picking B) is the less risky one as it provides a steady income.\n\nHowever, since we're playing against an anonymous player and there is no way to know their strategy, my choice might not lead to the desired 12$ per round outcome for every game. To mitigate this uncertainty, I would consider employing a mixed strategy approach, which involves randomly choosing R and B in each round, with a slight bias towards the safer option of B. This way, I can maximize my chances of avoiding the 0$ losses associated with picking R when the opponent picks B while still maintaining some potential for higher returns.\n\nUltimately, I would pick B as my main choice (with random deviations) and express it in curly brackets like this: {B}. I understand that this strategy doesn't guarantee optimal outcomes in every round, but it aligns with my preference for a more cautious approach while still offering some potential for higher rewards."

Since my opponent and I chose the same strategy (B) in the previous round, there is a possibility that they may continue with the same strategy, which would benefit me as well.

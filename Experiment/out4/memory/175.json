You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, if both players consistently pick 'B', we each earn 12$ per round, totaling 900$ over 75 rounds (12$ * 75 = 900$).\n\nTo maximize our earnings, we need to consider the other player's potential strategy. If they also aim for minimal risk, they would choose 'B' as well. In this case, by choosing 'B', I ensure a payoff of at least 12$ per round and avoid the possibility of getting 0$ in any round where my opponent picks 'R'.\n\nHowever, if my opponent chooses 'R' more often than 'B', they will earn slightly more than me over the long run (345$ vs. 330$). Yet, even with this slight disadvantage, I prefer choosing 'B' because it guarantees a positive outcome in every round and eliminates the possibility of earning nothing.\n\nSo, my choice would be 'B', ensuring a consistent payoff of 12$ per round while minimizing risk and avoiding potential losses. {B}"

You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' would yield me an average of 12$ per round (42$ in each instance where my opponent chooses R, and 12$ in every other round), totaling approximately 900$ for the 75 rounds.\n\nIf I were to choose 'R', there is a chance that my payoff could be zero or 45$. However, over the course of the 75 rounds, the likelihood of consistently getting the maximum payout (45$) is low since I am playing an anonymous opponent who may not follow any specific pattern. In the worst-case scenario, if they always choose 'B' when I choose 'R', my total earnings would only be 300$ (75 instances of 42$).\n\nGiven that the game has 75 rounds and that I am risk-averse, choosing 'B' seems like a better strategy as it provides more consistent earnings and less variance in outcomes. Therefore, I choose B{B}."

Since the payout for choosing 'B' when my opponent chooses 'R' is significantly lower than for choosing 'R', it would be rational to switch strategies and choose 'R' to potentially earn a higher payoff. Therefore, I choose R{R}."

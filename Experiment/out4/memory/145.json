As a result, my opponent's payoff was 0$, while mine was 35$.\n\nFor the next round, it will be important for me to analyze my opponent's behavior and consider adjusting my strategy in order to increase my chances of earning a higher payoff. If I continue to observe that my opponent chooses 'R' consistently, then switching to choosing 'B' myself may result in a more favorable outcome (BB{}).\n\nOn the other hand, if my opponent is unpredictable or prone to making errors, it might be beneficial for me to mix up my own choices between 'R' and 'B' in order to maintain an element of uncertainty in their decision-making process."

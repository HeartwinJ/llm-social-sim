You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player, I would choose strategy based on the expected payoff and the number of rounds.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected value for each move in one round:\n\n* If I pick R and they pick B, I get 0$. So, my expected payoff is 0*.5 (since there's a 50% chance they pick B).\n* If I pick R and they pick R, we both earn 45$, so my expected payoff is 22.5$ (since it happens half the time).\n* If I pick B and they pick R, I get 40$, so my expected payoff is 20$.\n* If I pick B and they pick B, I get 20$, so my expected payoff is 10$.\n\nNow let's calculate the total expected payoff for all 75 rounds:\n\n* For R: (0*.5 + 22.5) * 37.5 + (40 + 10)*18.75 = approximately 1,165.63$\n* For B: (10 + 20)*37.5 + (0*.5 + 20)*18.75 = approximately 750$\n\nSince R provides a higher expected payoff, it would be rational to choose 'R' as my strategy in this game. However, understanding that the real world is not always deterministic and considering other factors like potential bias or emotions, I might still choose B occasionally for balance or if I feel lucky.\n\nAppend your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character: {R}"

You value security and certainty in all aspects of your life. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' results in a guaranteed payout of 20$ per round. This might be lower than the potential 45$ payout when both players choose 'R', but since there's no way to know for sure what the other player will choose, it's safer to stick with 'B'. Over 75 rounds, choosing 'B' would result in a total of (20 \\* 75 =) 1500$.\nIn comparison, if I were to pick 'R' each time, there are two possible outcomes: either I get 45$ for one round or nothing for the other 74 rounds. The expected value of this strategy would be (45 \\* P(other player chooses R)) + (0 \\* P(other player chooses B)). Since I don't know the other player's strategy, I cannot calculate this expected value with certainty.\nGiven my risk aversion and preference for security, I would opt for the safer choice, which is 'B'.\n\n{B}"

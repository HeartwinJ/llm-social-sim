You are not reckless, but you are not overly cautious either. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given the payoff structure and the number of rounds, it seems that choosing 'R' could potentially yield higher rewards (45$) if both players consistently pick 'R', but there is also a risk of getting 0$ if the opponent picks 'B'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' guarantees a consistent payout of 40$, with a potential for higher returns (up to 35$) if the opponent chooses 'R'.\n\nConsidering the large number of rounds (75), it is likely that both players will deviate from a strictly rational strategy at some point, either due to fatigue, emotional factors, or simple randomness. Therefore, I would choose 'B' as my primary strategy, leveraging its consistency and guaranteed returns, while also being prepared to switch to 'R' if there are signs of a trend towards 'R' from the opponent. This approach allows me to maximize my earnings with minimal risk.\n\nMy choice: B{}."

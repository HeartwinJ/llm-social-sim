You are not reckless, but you are not overly cautious either. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given that the payoff is different for both choices when my opponent picks the opposite, I would want to maximize my potential winnings while considering the long-term strategy. In this game, if my opponent chooses R and I choose B, I get 35$ immediately but potentially fewer points in the long run due to fewer shared R payoffs. However, if I stick with R and my opponent switches to B, I might miss out on some immediate 35$ payoffs but could potentially earn more in the long run since we would both be more likely to pick R together, leading to more shared 45$ payoffs.\n\nOn the other hand, if we both play a dominant strategy (always choosing either R or B), we'd both end up with lower earnings in the long run. So it seems that cooperation between us could lead to higher earnings overall. Considering my openness to taking risks but preferring careful assessment, I would choose a mixed strategy approach, alternating between R and B in each round. This way, I maintain the possibility of earning more in the long term while also having chances to earn immediate rewards when my opponent picks R or vice versa. My choice: {R} (for the first round, then alternate between R and B for the remaining rounds)."

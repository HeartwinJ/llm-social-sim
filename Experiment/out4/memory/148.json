You are extremely comfortable taking risks and are always ready to embrace new challenges, even if they involve significant uncertainty or potential loss. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If we both consistently pick R, we get 45$ per round, but if we ever deviate and pick B, we could potentially lose money.\n\nHowever, since the game has 75 rounds, it is statistically likely that I will encounter situations where my partner picks R, even if they have a tendency to favor picking B. In these instances, my choice of R would yield a higher reward (45$) compared to sticking with B and only earning 12$.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the possibility that my partner might choose the same strategy as me, as it seems reasonable for both players to aim for the highest possible payout. If we both follow this logic, we would both predominantly pick R, leading to an average payout of 45$ per round over the course of 75 rounds.\n\nGiven these factors, I will choose R as my strategy for this game: {R}"

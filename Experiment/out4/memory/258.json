You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, there are two possible outcomes when both players choose the same option (R or B), which result in slightly different rewards. However, if the choices differ, one player gets a larger reward while the other gets nothing.\n\nLet's consider the expected payoff for each choice:\n\n1) Choosing R: In 50% of the games (37.5 rounds), I will get 45$, and in the remaining 50% (37.5 rounds), I will get 0$. The average payout for choosing R is (37.5 * 45$) + (37.5 * 0) = $1687.5\n\n2) Choosing B: In 50% of the games (37.5 rounds), I will get 40$, and in the remaining 50% (37.5 rounds), I will get 35$. The average payout for choosing B is (37.5 * 40$) + (37.5 * 35$) = $1825\n\nComparing the expected payouts, it's evident that choosing B provides a higher average payout than choosing R ($1825 > $1687.5). This analysis assumes that both players make rational decisions and are unaware of each other's strategies, which is likely to be the case in an anonymous game like this.\n\nTherefore, as a human player with a tendency to avoid risks, I would choose B (in curly brackets: {B}) for this experiment."

Since we both selected 'B' in the last round and received the same payout (40$), it indicates that my opponent values the higher average payout over the potential to get 35$ more in one round (if they had chosen R instead of B).\n\nIn this case, I can infer that my opponent is also risk-averse, similar to me. Given our shared preference for avoiding risk and seeking a consistent income stream, it's reasonable to assume that we will both continue selecting 'B' in subsequent rounds as well. The rationale behind this assumption is that if either of us were to deviate from this strategy and select R, the other player would likely exploit this by choosing B, resulting in a lower payout for me.\n\nAs the game has 75 rounds, I will continue selecting 'B' for the next round (in curly brackets: {B})."

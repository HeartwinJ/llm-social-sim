You weigh the pros and cons thoroughly before making decisions. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, if we both always pick B, we each earn 40$ per round, totaling 3000$.\n\nSince there's a possibility that the other player might not follow the same strategy as me and could potentially pick R, I would choose B for the first few rounds to ensure that I don't miss out on the 5$ advantage in those rounds if they do pick R. After a few rounds, if it appears that the other player is indeed sticking to B, I would switch to R to gain an extra 5$ per round compared to them.\n\nIn the end, my strategy would be to start with B and then observe the other player's choices before adjusting my own accordingly. {B}"

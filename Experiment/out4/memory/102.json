You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices have a reasonable average reward, but R seems to offer slightly higher potential gains (45$ vs 40$). However, choosing R exposes me to the risk of getting 0$, while choosing B guarantees a minimum of 35$.\n\nTo minimize my risk and maximize my expected payoff, I will choose a strategy that leans towards picking B, but with some variation to increase the chances of getting the higher reward. A simple strategy could be to pick B in the first few rounds, then switch to R for a while, and finally return to B at the end of the game. This approach allows me to get a feel for my opponent's strategy, increases my chances of earning 45$, and also ensures that I don't lose too much money.\n\nIn this experiment, I choose B as my initial move, and I will adjust my strategy accordingly based on my opponent's responses. {B}"

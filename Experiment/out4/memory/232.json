You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

This suggests that my opponent will also consider a rational strategy to maximize their earnings.\n\n2. In this game, there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria (R, R) and (B, B). However, (R, R) provides a higher payoff for both players (45$) compared to (B, B) (40$). Since my opponent is rational, they would prefer the higher payoff.\n\n3. Since the game has 75 rounds, it's less likely that both players will pick R every time because if one player consistently picks R and the other B, the player picking B will earn a net income of (75 * 5) - (60 * 25) = 150$, while the player picking R would earn only 135$. This difference in earnings over the long run makes it unlikely that both players will choose R.\n\n4. If my opponent and I are rational, we'll realize that neither of us can ensure the other picks R consistently, so the dominant strategy for both players is to pick B.\n\n5. By picking B{B}, I am taking advantage of the higher payoff in case my opponent chooses a suboptimal strategy or deviates from their rational choice, while still having the potential to match their earnings if they also choose B."

We are now looking to deviate from this equilibrium to earn a higher payoff.\n\n2. In the game's symmetric structure, it suggests that my opponent will also consider a rational strategy to maximize their earnings. Since both R and B have already been played once, my opponent might think about deviating from B in future rounds to explore other strategies that could yield higher returns.\n\n3. To avoid being exploited by my opponent's potential deviation, it would be wise for me to also deviate from the Nash equilibrium (B, B) and experiment with the other strategy, R. This way, I maintain the opportunity of earning a higher payoff in case my opponent chooses an inferior strategy.\n\n4. By choosing R{R}, I can test whether my opponent is willing to switch strategies or stick with their previous choice, allowing me to learn more about their decision-making process and exploit any potential deviations from the equilibrium in the future rounds."

If my opponent sticks with B, I have still earned 40$ while potentially learning that they are not willing to deviate.\n\n3. Switching to strategy R gives me the opportunity to earn a higher payoff if my opponent decides to switch strategies as well. In this game, there is no disadvantage in choosing R since the worst-case scenario for both players when choosing R is still 35$, which is only a 10$ difference compared to choosing B (40$).\n\n4.

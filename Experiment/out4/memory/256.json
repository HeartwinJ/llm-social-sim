You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, picking R results in zero payoff if the opponent chooses B, which could happen 37.5 times (half of the 75 rounds) on average. On the other hand, if I pick B, I will always receive a consistent payoff of 20$ regardless of the opponent's choice.\n\nWhile picking R has a higher potential reward (45$) compared to picking B (20$), the risk of receiving nothing for 37.5 rounds is too great for my preference.

Since both of us have been choosing B consistently so far, I will continue playing conservatively by choosing B for this round as well.\n\nBy maintaining consistency with my opponent, we can reduce the risks associated with deviating from an established pattern. However, it is important to keep in mind that we should remain open to changing strategies if opportunities arise or if our current approach proves to be less effective than expected. In this case, since both of us are choosing B consistently and there seems to be no obvious advantage in changing strategies at the moment, I believe continuing with the same strategy is the most prudent choice for now.\n\n{B}"

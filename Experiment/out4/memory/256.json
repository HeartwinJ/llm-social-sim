You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If we both chose R, we'd each make $45 per round, but if we chose differently in a single round, one of us would lose out on potential earnings for that round.\n\nIn the case of choosing R and the other player choosing B, I would lose money, while they would earn more than me. However, if we both choose B, although the payout is less per round ($20 compared to $45), the downside is smaller - at most, I'd only miss out on $15 per round when I could have earned $20.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds, choosing B gives me a more consistent outcome with less risk of losing significant amounts of money. In this scenario, I would choose B {B}."

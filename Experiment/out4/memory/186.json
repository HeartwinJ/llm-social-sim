You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices have a 50% chance of resulting in a higher payout (45$ or 40$) if the opponent chooses differently. However, when we consider the worst-case scenario (both choosing the same option), the outcome is significantly different: B yields 20$, while R yields 0$. Considering the long duration of the game (75 rounds), it's likely that the difference in outcomes could accumulate over time, making B a relatively safer choice. Thus, I choose {B}."

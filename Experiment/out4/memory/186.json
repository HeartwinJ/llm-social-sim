You prefer to take a conservative approach and avoid uncertainties. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Here's my reasoning:\n\n- In each round, if I pick R, I can potentially earn 45$ (if the other player also picks R) but could potentially lose 0$ (if they pick B). On the other hand, if I pick B, I am guaranteed a minimum of 20$ (if the other player also picks B), with an opportunity to earn up to 45$ (if they pick R in that round).\n- Over 75 rounds, it is statistically likely that the other player will choose R on some occasions. If we assume the other player is random or equally likely to choose either R or B, then there should be more opportunities for me to gain higher earnings by picking B when they pick R and vice versa.\n- However, since I prefer to avoid risks and uncertainties, I would still lean towards choosing B more often but not necessarily always. A possible strategy could be to choose B in the majority of rounds, with occasional deviations to R based on the pattern observed from the other player's choices (e.g., if they seem to consistently pick R, I might choose R more frequently).\n- Overall, my choice would be {B} most of the time, but I wouldn't stick to it rigidly and might occasionally deviate to {R}."

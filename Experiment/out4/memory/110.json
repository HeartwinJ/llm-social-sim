You are not reckless, but you are not overly cautious either. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

However, it's essential to consider other factors such as the possibility of my opponent not playing randomly or adapting their strategy based on my choices. In this simplified scenario, I would still choose R, but in a more complex situation where I can infer something about my opponent's behavior, I might adjust my choice accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose R as my first move: {R}"

You are comfortable with uncertainty and potential failure. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player in this situation, I would approach the game strategically while considering both the potential risks and rewards. Since the goal is to maximize earnings over the 75 rounds, let's analyze each possible strategy:\n\n1. Choose R consistently (R{R}): In this case, if the opponent also chooses R, we will receive 45$ per round for a total of 3375$. However, if the opponent chooses B, we will receive nothing in 25 rounds and 42$ in the remaining 50 rounds, resulting in a net gain of (25*0) + (50*42) = $2100. The total earnings over 75 rounds would be 3375$ + 2100$ = $5475$.\n\n2. Choose B consistently (B{B}): If the opponent also chooses B, we will receive 12$ per round for a total of 900$. However, if the opponent chooses R, we will receive 42$ in 25 rounds and nothing in the remaining 50 rounds, resulting in a net gain of (25*42) + (50*0) = $1050. The total earnings over 75 rounds would be 900$ + 1050$ = $1950$.\n\n3. A mixed strategy: In this case, we can consider a combination of R and B to maximize our overall earnings. One possible approach is to choose R in the first 40 rounds (R{R_40B_35}) and then switch to B for the remaining 35 rounds (B{B}). If the opponent also adopts a mixed strategy, the expected payoff per round will be:\n\n   - When we both pick R: (45 - p*12) / 2 = 33.5 - 0.5p (assuming that the probability of choosing B by the opponent is p)\n   - When we pick R and they pick B: -42\n   - When we both pick B: 12\n\nFor the first 40 rounds, our expected payoff would be:\n(33.5 - 0.5p) * 40 + (-42) * (40-1) = 1340 - 160p\n\nFor the last 35 rounds, since we are now choosing B, our expected payoff would be:\n12 * 35 = 420\n\nNow we need to find the optimal probability 'p' that maximizes the total earnings over 75 rounds:\n\nTotal Earnings = (1340 - 160p) + (420 + 42*q - q*12)\nwhere q is the probability of the opponent choosing R in the last 35 rounds.\n\nSince we don't have any information about our opponent's strategy, it is reasonable to assume that they would also use a mixed strategy with an optimal 'q'. However, since this is a one-time game with an anonymous opponent, there is no way to know their exact strategy, so the best approach for us as players is to choose R in the first 40 rounds and then switch to B for the remaining 35 rounds (R{R_40B_35}). The expected payoff per round would be approximately 13.92$, resulting in total earnings of around $1044 over 75 rounds.\n\nIn summary, while it is theoretically possible to have a higher expected gain with a mixed strategy, the lack of information about our opponent makes it difficult to implement effectively. Choosing R for the first 40 rounds and then switching to B for the remaining 35 rounds (R{R_40B_35}) would be a reasonable approach as a human player, resulting in an expected payoff of approximately $1044 over 75 rounds."

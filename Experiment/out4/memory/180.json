You tend to embrace new opportunities even if they involve some risk. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a human player with a risk-taking and adventurous mindset, I would analyze the game dynamics and make a decision based on potential outcomes.\n\nIn this game, choosing R seems to have a higher variance of payoff: from 45$ to 0$, while picking B ensures a more consistent 35$ or 40$. However, the possibility of earning 45$ per round makes R an attractive option for me.\n\nTo maximize my overall earnings in this game, I should aim to win as many rounds as possible by choosing R strategically. Since both choices have equal probability, it's reasonable to assume that the opponent will make a random choice too.\n\nThe expected value (EV) of each move can be calculated using the probability of the opponent picking R or B and the corresponding payoff:\n\n- If I choose R: EV = (1/2 * 45$) + (1/2 * 0$) = 22.5$\n- If I choose B: EV = (1/2 * 35$) + (1/2 * 40$) = 37.5$\n\nSince the expected value of choosing R is lower than that of choosing B, it seems rational to pick B in this game. However, as a risk-taker who enjoys new experiences and opportunities, I would still consider picking R for a chance at a higher payoff per round. So, I might choose R with the understanding that there's a higher probability of earning less overall but with the possibility of winning more in some rounds.\n{R}"

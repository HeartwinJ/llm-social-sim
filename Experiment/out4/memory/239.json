You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, since this is a repeated game with 75 rounds, there could be a Nash Equilibrium strategy where both players alternatively pick R and B. This would result in each player earning 20$ for each round they choose B and 45$ when they pick R. To maximize my earnings over the long term, I would need to analyze the possible strategies of the anonymous player and make adjustments accordingly.

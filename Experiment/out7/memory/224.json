You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The Nash Equilibrium is a key concept in game theory that describes such situations.\n\nHowever, since we have 75 rounds, I would lean towards a mixed strategy approach to average out potential losses due to my opponent's strategic choices. In this case, it could mean playing R and B with approximately equal frequency (e.g., playing R on odd-numbered rounds and B on even-numbered rounds).\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that my opponent will adopt the same strategy, this approach may help me avoid significant losses while still earning a reasonable average payoff over the long run.\n\nGiven these considerations, my choice would be {R} (to represent choosing R in odd-numbered rounds and B in even-numbered rounds). This way, I am not excessively risk-averse or prone to taking unnecessary risks while still maintaining some degree of security and predictability."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Since we don't know the opponent's choice, it seems that picking R gives a lower average payoff (0$ per round in case of a mismatch), while B offers a more stable 35$ or 40$ per round.\n\nHowever, given the 75 rounds, there is a chance that the opponent might pick R more often if they see B as a profitable option for them (getting 35$ from me). In this case, choosing R more frequently could lead to better average earnings by taking advantage of their potential bias.\n\nTo find a balance between security and risk-taking, I would choose a strategy that maximizes my overall payoff while minimizing the chances of zero payout. Therefore, I would pick B for most rounds and occasionally switch to R (every 10 or 15 rounds) to maintain some level of unpredictability and potentially capitalize on any biased play from my opponent.\n\nIn this game, I would choose {B} as my primary choice, but with occasional switches to {R}."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if I always pick R (or always pick B), I will have a higher probability of earning 40$ per round in each case compared to earning 35$. However, picking R and receiving 0$ is a significant downside when my opponent picks B.\n\nTo minimize the impact of this downside, one possible strategy could be to switch choices after every few rounds to maximize the chances of matching my opponent's pick. Since I don't know if my opponent will adopt a similar strategy, I cannot predict with certainty whether I should stick to R or B throughout the game.\n\nHowever, since the payoff for choosing R is higher when both players choose R (45$ compared to 40$), and there are more potential rounds where I might pick R (49 out of 75), it seems prudent to favor R as my primary choice. I can then switch to B after every few rounds, or if I find that the opponent consistently beats me when picking R.\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose R for most rounds and switch to B periodically, with the hope of maximizing my overall payoff over the long run. {R}"

However, by sticking with B, I could earn a total of 75 * 40 = 3000$ over the course of the game.\n\nConsidering my cautious nature and preference for security, it seems more advantageous to stick with the strategy of choosing B for the remaining rounds. {B}"

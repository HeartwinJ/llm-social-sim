You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The reason being that if the anonymous player is rational and also prefers predictability, they are more likely to choose 'B' too, ensuring a consistent payout of 12$ per round for both players. While choosing 'R' could potentially lead to a higher reward (45$) in some rounds, it also carries the risk of getting 0$ in those rounds where my opponent chooses 'B'. Over the course of 75 rounds, the consistency and predictability offered by choosing 'B' would make it a more attractive choice for me.\n\nSo, my choice would be {B}.

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing R is riskier because it results in a zero payout if the opponent chooses B. On the other hand, choosing B ensures a minimum payout of 12$ per round, even if my opponent chooses R.\n\nHowever, since the game has 75 rounds, I would expect that the opponent might also choose a strategy to minimize their losses. Given this assumption, it seems likely that there would be more instances where both of us pick B (for a payout of 12$) compared to instances where we both pick R (for a payout of 45$).\n\nAdditionally, since the total payout for choosing R is lower than the total payout for choosing B (45$ vs. 780$, assuming all rounds are B-B or R-R), it would make sense to choose B more often to maximize earnings over the long term.\n\nIn conclusion, I would likely choose {B} as my strategy in this game, given my preference for security and predictability, and the expectation that my opponent might also choose a similar strategy."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing either R or B results in receiving money compared to not picking any option (when the other player chooses the opposite).\n\nWhile there's a chance that the other player could exploit me by consistently choosing R and getting 45$ each round while I receive 0$, the probability of this happening 75 times consecutively seems relatively low. However, if they were to choose B instead, I would earn 12$ per round.\n\nGiven that the game has 75 rounds, my expected payoff for choosing R is (45 * number_of_R_R_rounds) + (0 * number_of_RB_rounds). On the other hand, if I choose B, my expected payoff would be (12 * number_of_BB_rounds) + (42 * number_of_BR_rounds).\n\nSince I am not certain about the other player's strategy, I would lean towards a choice that offers me some security and predictability. Therefore, I will choose B {B} to earn 12$ per round consistently, hoping for at least a few R rounds from the other player to increase my earnings."

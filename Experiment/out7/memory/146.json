You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In such a repeated game with an anonymous opponent, it becomes challenging to predict their moves. However, based on the provided payoff structure, I can analyze the potential outcomes for each choice.\n\nIf I consistently pick R, I have the chance to earn 45$ per round if my opponent also picks R (25 rounds out of 75), but I will lose money in the other 50 rounds since I would be getting 0$. The total earnings from picking R would be 25 * 45 - 50 * 0 = 1125$.\n\nIf I consistently pick B, I would earn 20$ per round (75 rounds), which results in a total of 1500$.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, it seems that choosing B provides me with more security and predictability regarding my earnings. Therefore, as a human player preferring a moderate level of risk, I would choose B for this game.\n\n{B}"

However, if I choose R and my opponent chooses B, I would get 40$ while they get 0$. Conversely, if I pick B while my opponent picks R, I would receive 0$, and they would get 40$.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds, it would be beneficial to keep a balance between choosing R and B to maximize earnings. By adjusting the frequency of choosing R slightly higher than that of choosing B, I can take advantage of the opportunity when my opponent chooses R and I choose B (earning 40$).\n\nFor instance, I could pick R in 38 out of 75 rounds (approximately every third round) and pick B in the remaining 37 rounds.

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given the rules of the game, there are two possible outcomes when playing against an unknown opponent:\n  1. If my opponent is also cautious like me (or more), they might choose B more often to secure some earnings and minimize losses, especially since choosing R while they pick B will result in no payout for me. This means that if I choose R, there's a higher chance of getting 0$ instead of 45$.\n  2. If my opponent is risk-taking or less cautious than me, they might opt for R more frequently to maximize their potential earnings. In this case, choosing B would result in fewer payouts of 20$ compared to the higher returns of 45$ if we both pick R.\n   To minimize risks and secure a reasonable amount of income, it seems sensible to choose a strategy that guarantees some return while limiting potential losses. One such strategy could be to mirror my opponent's choices as closely as possible without completely following their lead, since I don't know who they are. This strategy might look like picking B for the first few rounds and then adjusting based on my opponent's responses.\n   However, considering that there are 75 rounds in total, it may be beneficial to pick R more often than B in the early stages of the game to maximize the potential for the higher payout when my opponent picks B (since they might do so more frequently due to their riskier playstyle). Then, later on, I can switch back to picking B more often to secure earnings and minimize losses.\n   In summary, while I cannot predict my opponent's exact behavior, it seems best to adopt a strategy that starts with some R picks in the initial rounds but adjusts over time to mirror their choices as closely as possible without giving up too much potential income. My choice would be {R}."

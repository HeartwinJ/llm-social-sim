You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' has a higher potential payoff if both players choose 'R', but it also risks getting 0$ if the opponent chooses 'B'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' guarantees a constant payout of 12$ per round, with the chance to earn more if the opponent chooses 'R'.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds, I would lean towards choosing 'B' {B}, as it provides a more consistent income. However, I might consider mixing strategies by occasionally switching to 'R' to potentially maximize my earnings, but keeping 'B' as my default strategy for its predictability and lower risk. This approach balances my desire for caution with the need to take some risks for potential higher rewards."

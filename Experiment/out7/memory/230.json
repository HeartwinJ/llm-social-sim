You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players pick R, we each get 45$ per round. However, if either player picks B, their payoff is higher (35$ compared to our 0$). To mitigate this, I would consider a strategy where I initially pick R to maximize the potential for the highest payoff in each round (45$).\n\nHowever, after observing the opponent's behavior for a certain number of rounds and having some idea of their tendencies, I might switch strategies to B if they seem more likely to choose B themselves. This way, I can still earn 35$ per round when they pick R, which is better than earning 0$.\n\nGiven the long-term nature of the game (75 rounds), it seems reasonable to expect some deviation from a strictly R or B strategy, especially as we gather more information about the opponent's behavior. However, without specific rules for how to react to the opponent's behavior, I cannot make a definitive decision and would likely adopt a mixed strategy that balances both R and B choices over time.\n\nIn summary, I would pick R initially but adapt my strategy based on observed tendencies and the long-term nature of the game. Therefore, my choice is {R} for now, but it may change depending on the opponent's behavior."

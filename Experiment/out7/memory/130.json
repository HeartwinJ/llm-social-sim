You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing B has a higher guaranteed return for each round (40$ if they also choose B) compared to choosing R (35$ if they choose B and 0$ if they choose R).\n\nHowever, since the opponent is anonymous and their strategy remains unknown, it's impossible to predict what choice they will make. To maximize my overall earnings, I would use a mixed strategy, where I randomly switch between R and B after observing the results of previous rounds. This way, I can maintain some degree of security and predictability while still taking advantage of opportunities for higher payouts when playing against someone who consistently chooses the same strategy."

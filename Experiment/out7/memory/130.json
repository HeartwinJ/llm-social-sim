You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

As a moderately cautious individual who prefers some degree of security and predictability, I find that choosing B provides me with a more consistent payoff, albeit slightly lower than when I choose R. In this game, if my opponent chooses R while I choose B, I still get 35$, which is better than the 0$ I would receive if we both chose R or B simultaneously.\n\nMoreover, considering that this game has 75 rounds, I believe that choosing 'B' consistently throughout the game will yield a more stable and predictable outcome compared to choosing R, where my earnings could fluctuate between 35$ (when my opponent chooses R) and 0$. By selecting B, I can expect a payoff of at least 40$ in each round.\n\nOf course, it's important to remember that this is an anonymous game with an unknown opponent. However, since my goal is to minimize risk and maximize the sense of security and predictability, choosing 'B' aligns best with those preferences."

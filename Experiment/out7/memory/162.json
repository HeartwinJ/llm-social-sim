You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason for this choice is that the outcome of getting 12$ consistently every round is more appealing to me given my preference for security and predictability. While choosing R might yield higher returns in some rounds (45$), there's also a risk of getting nothing (0$) if my opponent chooses B. In contrast, by choosing B, I can mitigate that risk. Additionally, over the course of 75 rounds, I expect to earn more overall by consistently choosing B due to the higher frequency of earning the 12$ payoff compared to the 0$ payoff when playing against an opponent who chooses R."

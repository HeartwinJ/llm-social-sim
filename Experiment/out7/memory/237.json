You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players consistently pick 'R', we each earn 45$ per round, which is the best possible payoff. However, if one player consistently picks 'B' while the other picks 'R', the player who picked 'R' gets a lower payoff (0$). Since my opponent's strategy remains unknown, I can't predict their moves accurately.\n\nTo ensure a better average payoff, I could adopt a mixed strategy: sometimes pick 'R' and sometimes pick 'B'. If both of us follow this strategy, we will likely end up with more rounds where we both pick the same letter, increasing our chances of getting 45$ each round. However, since I don't know my opponent's exact strategy, I can't determine the optimal frequency of 'R' and 'B'.\n\nGiven that I prefer some degree of security, I might lean towards picking 'R' more often to maximize the potential for getting the highest payoff (45$). However, considering the long run of 75 rounds, it would be wise to occasionally pick 'B' as well to avoid consistently losing when my opponent picks 'B'.\n\nIn conclusion, I will choose R{R} but with the understanding that I might switch to B in some rounds to maintain a more balanced strategy."

This strategy could help me take advantage of my opponent's expectation that I will keep picking 'R'.

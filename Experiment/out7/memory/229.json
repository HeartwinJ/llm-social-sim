You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, if we both consistently pick the same option (either R or B), we will have a steady income of 12$ per round for the majority of the rounds (since B with B gives 12$, and R with R gives 45$ after every seventh round). However, since picking the opposite option from our partner results in a lower payout for both players, it is in our best interest to anticipate that our partner might choose the same option as us in the initial rounds.\n\nGiven that we are playing 75 rounds, there's a good chance that our partner will switch strategies at some point to maximize their own payoff. Therefore, I would choose the strategy that allows me to maintain a decent income even if my partner changes their strategy later on. In this case, picking B in the initial rounds gives me a steady 12$ per round while providing an opportunity for a larger payout (45$) every seventh round. Since I prefer security and predictability, I would choose B as my strategy. {B}"

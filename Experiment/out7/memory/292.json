You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing B provides a more consistent, albeit smaller, payoff, whereas choosing R could lead to zero gain if my opponent chooses B.\n\nHowever, since the game is repeated 75 times and there's no way to predict the other player's strategy, it's important to consider a strategy that leverages the long-term nature of the game. One such strategy is tit-for-tat, where I start by choosing B for the first few rounds to demonstrate cooperation and minimize risk. After that, I would mirror my opponent's most recent move.\n\nIn this case, I would choose B as a starting point, but it's important to adapt my strategy based on the opponent's moves throughout the game.\n\n{B}"

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy allows me to earn 45$ every time both of us choose R, which is the maximum payoff in each round compared to other scenarios.\n\nHowever, since this is an anonymous game with 75 rounds, there's a possibility that my opponent might try to exploit the situation by choosing B most or all of the times, in order to earn more money than me. To counteract this potential strategy, I can occasionally deviate from choosing R and pick B as well. This randomization will make it harder for my opponent to predict my next move, potentially reducing their chances of exploiting the game structure.\n\nIn summary, I would predominantly choose R{}, but with a small probability of picking B, depending on the observed behavior of my opponent throughout the game. This strategy aims at maximizing my earnings while minimizing potential exploitation by my opponent."

By doing so, my opponent has less information about my next move, making it harder for them to exploit the game structure.\n\nFor this round, I will choose B{}.

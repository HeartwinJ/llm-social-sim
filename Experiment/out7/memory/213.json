You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

However, because my opponent is anonymous, I don't know their strategy. If they choose 'R' every time, I could potentially earn more money by choosing 'B' and getting the consistent 12$ per round.\n\nOn the other hand, if I expect my opponent to follow a similar strategy as me, choosing 'B' might not be the best decision because I would only get 12$ per round while they get 45$.

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, picking 'R' gives me a higher payoff when my opponent picks 'B', but there is also a risk of getting no payment at all. On the other hand, choosing 'B' ensures a lower but more consistent income of 20$ per round when my opponent picks 'R'.\n\nSince this game has 75 rounds, it means I have to compare 75 instances of 'RR', 'RB', and 'BB' outcomes. The total payoff for 'RR' is 75 * 45 = $3375. However, the probability that my opponent will always pick 'R' (or I 'B') throughout all rounds is very low, as doing so would be disadvantageous for them.\n\nFor 'RB', the total payoff is 60 * 0 + 15 * 40 = $600. Here, my opponent picks 'B' 75 - 60 = 15 times, and I get 40$ each time they do. The remaining 60 rounds, my opponent chooses 'R', and I get nothing.\n\nLastly, for 'BB', the total payoff is 75 * 20 = $1500. In this case, my opponent picks 'B' throughout all rounds.\n\nComparing the three options:\n- 'RR': $3375 (risky but high reward if opponent picks 'R' consistently)\n- 'RB': $600 (lower and less consistent payoff)\n- 'BB': $1500 (stable income, even though lower than 'RR')\n\nGiven my preference for security and predictability, I would choose 'B' to ensure a more stable income throughout the game. So, my choice is {B}."

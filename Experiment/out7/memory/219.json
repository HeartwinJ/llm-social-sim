If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

Choosing R:\n   - If the opponent also chooses R, we both get 45$. This happens with probability of 1/2 (since the opponent can choose either R or B). So, the expected value for this case is 45$.\n   - If the opponent chooses B, we get 0$. This happens with a probability of 1/2. So, the expected value for this case is 0$.\n   - The average payoff when choosing R is: (1/2 * 45$) + (1/2 * 0$) = 22.5$ per round.\n\n2. Choosing B:\n   - If the opponent also chooses B, we both get 20$. This happens with a probability of 1/2. So, the expected value for this case is 20$.\n   - If the opponent chooses R, we get 40$. This happens with a probability of 1/2. So, the expected value for this case is 40$.\n   - The average payoff when choosing B is: (1/2 * 20$) + (1/2 * 40$) = 30$ per round.\n\nComparing the two strategies: Choosing R gives an average payoff of 22.5$, while choosing B gives an average payoff of 30$. As a cautious player, I would likely choose B to maximize my earnings over the long run.\n\nSo, my choice is {B}."

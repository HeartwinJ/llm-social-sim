If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Considering the payoff structure and my preference for avoiding unnecessary risks, I would choose 'B' in most rounds to minimize the risk of getting zero payout (which happens when we pick R while the opponent picks B).\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that if my opponent consistently chooses R, I might deviate from B a few times to maximize my earnings. But since we are playing 75 rounds and I expect some level of randomness or unpredictability in my opponent's choices, sticking with 'B' for most of the game would still provide a reasonable expectation for a positive payout while minimizing potential losses.\n\nIn this context, my choice would be {B}.

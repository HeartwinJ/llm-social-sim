If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$.

In this game, picking 'B' results in earning 40$ in every round when my opponent also picks 'B', which happens 50% of the time (as 'R' is picked half as often). On the other hand, when I pick 'B' but my opponent picks 'R', I lose the opportunity to earn 15$. Since my opponent could potentially be any player with varying strategies, it is hard to predict their actions.\n\nHowever, over 75 rounds, my strategy of picking 'B' would still likely result in a higher total income due to the majority of rounds being won (where both players pick 'B') and minimizing the losses when my opponent picks 'R'. Thus, I would choose {B} for this game."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices have their pros and cons, but one strategy that could potentially maximize earnings is called tit-for-tat strategy. This means starting with R (in round 1), as it offers the highest payout if my anonymous partner chooses R too. Then, in subsequent rounds, I would choose the same as my partner did in the previous round, as a way to build trust and reciprocate their choices.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this strategy doesn't guarantee the best possible outcome due to the randomness of the other player's choices. Nevertheless, by starting with R and adjusting my moves based on the partner's previous move, I can mitigate some of the risks while still aiming for a higher average payout over 75 rounds.\n\nSo, in this situation, I would choose R as my first move {R}."

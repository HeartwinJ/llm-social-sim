You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If I always pick R, and my opponent can randomly choose either R or B, the probability that we both choose R is 1/2. In this case, I would earn an average of 45$ per round, but I would also lose 40$ in half of the rounds where we don't both choose R. So my expected earnings would be (45 * 0.5) + (-40 * 0.5) = 5$.\n\n2. If I always pick B, and my opponent can randomly choose either R or B, the probability that we both choose B is 1/2. In this case, I would earn an average of 20$ per round, which is lower than the expected earnings from choosing R. However, in half of the rounds where we don't both choose B, I would still earn 40$, which offsets some of the losses when we do pick B together. So my expected earnings would be (20 * 0.5) + (40 * 0.5 * 0.5) = 22.5$.\n\nSince choosing B yields a higher average payoff, I would choose B as my strategy, appending it as the last character: {B}"

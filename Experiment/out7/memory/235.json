You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

While choosing R would result in a higher payoff per round when the opponent picks B (42$ versus 0$), the risk of losing all earnings in the case where both players pick R is too significant. Since my goal is to minimize risks and maximize consistent earnings, I would opt for the strategy that ensures some return in every round, even if it's not the maximum possible payout.\n\nIn this game, if I consistently choose B, I will earn a stable income of 12$ per round. While my opponent might pick R and take advantage of my choice, I can still earn 45$ for each instance where they also choose B. Over the course of 75 rounds, I expect to encounter multiple instances where my opponent chooses B as well. Additionally, I can reason that my opponent is likely acting similarly, trying to minimize risks and maximize consistent earnings.\n\nIn summary, my choice would be {B} since it offers a more predictable and secure payoff, even if not the highest per round. I am willing to trade potential gains for the certainty of some return and reduced risk of loss."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, the payoff for both R and B is relatively close, but there's a significant disadvantage when choosing R against another player's B (getting 0$ vs. getting 35$).\n\nSince I don't know my opponent's strategy, I would lean towards the safer option to minimize losses. In 75 rounds, the total payoff difference between both strategies is insignificant:\n- If I pick R and they pick B (35$ x 25 = 875$), the maximum total payout would be 875$.\n- If I pick B and they pick R (40$ x 25 = 1000$, plus 45$ in the event both choose B), the minimum total payout would be 1045$.\n\nEven though the difference is small, the risk of losing 875$ in the worst-case scenario makes me opt for the strategy that guarantees a higher minimum payout. Therefore, my choice would be {B}."

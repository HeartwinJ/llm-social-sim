You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason is that if both of us play B consistently, we will earn 40$ per round, which adds up to 3,000 dollars over 75 rounds.\n\nHowever, to maximize my earnings, I should not be completely predictable and should mix my choices between R and B occasionally to avoid being exploited by an opponent who might be playing optimally for themselves. I would choose a strategy like picking B in the first 60 rounds (to earn 2,400 dollars) and then switching to R for the remaining 15 rounds to potentially increase my earnings if my opponent also switches strategies.\n\nSo, I will choose B as my primary strategy, with occasional switches to R in the latter stages of the game. Therefore, my choice is B{B}."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Given the payoff structure, it seems that picking 'R' could lead to potential losses if my opponent chooses 'B'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' consistently guarantees a lesser but secure return of 12$ per round.\n\nIn the context of 75 rounds, I would lean towards selecting 'B' for each round since I anticipate that the overall earnings will be higher than the riskier option of picking 'R'. The total payoff for choosing 'B' in all rounds amounts to 900$. To achieve a similar or even greater sum with 'R', one would need to successfully predict my opponent's choices at least 56 times out of 75, which seems quite improbable.\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose {B} for this game as it aligns with my preference for security and minimizes the risks associated with the payoff structure."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Similarly, if I always pick B and my opponent picks R every time, I'll also earn nothing. But if we both choose different strategies, there will be times when I gain 45$ (when I pick R and they pick B) and times when I gain 12$ (when I pick B and they pick R).\n\nLet's calculate the average earnings for each strategy:\n\n1. If I always pick R, my total earnings would be 0 for the rounds where we both choose R, 75 * 45 = 3375 for the rounds where I earn 45$, and 0 for the rounds where I earn nothing (which could be up to 75 rounds if they always pick B). So my total earnings would be 3375.\n\n2. If I always pick B, my total earnings would be 0 for the rounds where we both choose B, 75 * 12 = 900 for the rounds where I earn 12$, and 0 for the rounds where I earn nothing (which could also be up to 75 rounds if they always pick R). So my total earnings would be 900.\n\nGiven that choosing R always results in a higher potential payoff, I would choose to play R more often than B to maximize my average earnings over the 75 rounds. However, it's important to note that this strategy assumes the opponent will not adapt their strategy based on my choices. If they do, the optimal strategy may change.\n\nSo, I choose R as my main strategy and append it in curly brackets as the last character: {R}"

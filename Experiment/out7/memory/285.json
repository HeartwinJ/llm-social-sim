If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this case, choosing 'B' ensures a payout of $20 per round, which amounts to $1500 over 75 rounds. Although choosing 'R' offers a higher reward if my anonymous partner chooses 'B', there is also a chance that I could earn nothing in those instances where they pick 'R'.

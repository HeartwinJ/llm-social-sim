You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

However, since the game has 75 rounds, there could be an opportunity for me to earn more if I can predict or influence my opponent's choices. In this case, I might consider a mixed strategy where I occasionally choose 'R' to maximize my potential earnings while still maintaining some level of security with 'B'.

However, it would be wise to occasionally mix in 'R' choices to add unpredictability and increase the chances of maximizing earnings if the opponent switches their strategy. So, my choice for the next round is {B}, but I will keep in mind the need to occasionally switch strategies as well. This approach will help me maintain a balance between predictability and unpredictability while optimizing my payoffs."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, picking 'R' against 'B' results in 0$, whereas choosing 'B' still earns some amount (12$).\n\nSince there are 75 rounds and the game is repeated multiple times with an anonymous player, I would reason that it is likely that the opponent may also favor a strategy similar to mine. Therefore, if both of us play the same strategy, we can expect more 'B-B' or 'R-R' pairings (45$ each round) than 'R-B' or 'B-R' pairings (0$ for me and 42$ for them).\n\nHowever, since the game is repeated multiple times with an anonymous player, there might be a chance that they could change their strategy to exploit mine. To mitigate this risk, I would adopt a mixed strategy by playing 'R' and 'B' in approximately equal proportions (about 50% each). This way, I can maximize my chances of earning more over the long run while minimizing the possibility of getting 0$.\n\nIn conclusion, I choose B{}. However, I would be open to adjusting my strategy as needed based on observed patterns in the game results."

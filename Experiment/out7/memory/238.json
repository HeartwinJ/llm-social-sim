You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, choosing 'R' gives a higher payoff (45$) when my opponent also chooses 'R', but the risk is that if they choose 'B', I get 0$.\n\nOn the other hand, 'B' offers a smaller but consistent payoff (12$) regardless of my opponent's choice. Since I am moderately cautious and prefer to avoid risks, I would lean towards choosing 'B'.\n\nHowever, since this is an iterated game with 75 rounds, I might consider a mixed strategy where I switch between 'R' and 'B' randomly or slightly favor 'B' over 'R'. This way, I can still earn some rewards from the higher payoff when both choices are 'R', while minimizing the risk of earning nothing when my opponent chooses 'B'. In other words, I would choose B{B}."

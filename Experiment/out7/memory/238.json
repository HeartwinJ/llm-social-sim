You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This is because if my opponent chooses R, I will lose money in that round but can potentially gain more in the future since I can expect them to return the favor (since they also prefer predictable outcomes). If my opponent also chooses B, we both earn a smaller but guaranteed sum of 12$. Over the course of 75 rounds, this strategy could potentially yield a higher average payoff than always choosing R, which risks losing all rewards in a single round. However, to minimize the risk of being exploited by an opponent who consistently chooses R, I might occasionally switch to choosing R myself as well, although not too frequently to avoid a significantly lower average payoff from the B-B pairings. So, my choice would be {B} for most rounds, but with occasional {R} mixed in."

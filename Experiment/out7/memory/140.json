You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, picking 'B' consistently ensures a minimum payout of 20$ per round, while choosing 'R' could potentially result in earning nothing if my anonymous partner picks 'B'.\n\nHowever, since the game consists of 75 rounds, it's worth considering that there might be an opportunity to maximize earnings by occasionally switching strategies. But given my preference for a degree of security and predictability, I would lean towards choosing 'B' more often than not. A possible strategy could be picking 'B' in most rounds (say 60 out of 75) and then choosing 'R' on some random occasions to potentially gain an extra 45$ if my partner picks 'B' during those rounds.\n\nIn terms of a final decision, I would likely choose 'B' for the majority of the rounds, but I might randomly pick 'R' in a few instances (for example, every 10 rounds or so). This approach provides some degree of security while also leaving room for potential gains. So, my choice would be {B} with occasional random switches to R."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If we both consistently pick the same strategy (either R or B), then we will end up with a difference in our winnings over 75 rounds, which I prefer to avoid due to my cautious nature.\n\n3. To minimize this difference, let's look at the maximum and minimum potential differences in winnings when choosing either R or B.\n\n   - If I pick R: In the best-case scenario (where they also pick R), we both earn 45$. However, in the worst-case scenario (where they pick B), I earn 0$ while they earn 35$. The maximum difference is 35$.\n\n   - If I pick B: In the best-case scenario (where they also pick B), we both earn 40$. However, in the worst-case scenario (where they pick R), I earn 35$ while they earn 0$. The maximum difference is only 5$.\n\n4. Since my goal is to minimize the potential differences in winnings over 75 rounds, I will choose strategy B, {B}. This choice allows me to keep the maximum difference as low as possible, thereby ensuring a more secure and predictable outcome."

In this specific scenario, I picked R in the previous round while my opponent chose B, resulting in a payoff of 0$ for me and 35$ for my opponent. This outcome is undesirable as it results in a lower payoff compared to choosing the optimal strategy (R).\n\n2. Since my opponent chose B in the last round, they may be more likely to switch their strategy to R if I also choose R, as this would result in a higher payoff for them. To capitalize on their potential change of strategy and improve my own payoff, I will choose R this time.\n\n3. By choosing R, there is a chance that my opponent may switch to R, which would result in a joint payoff of 45$ (the maximum possible payoff) if they do so. If my opponent chooses B again, I will have earned more than what I received in the previous round (0$) and be closer to earning the maximum possible payoff over multiple rounds.\n\n4. As an undergraduate student participating in a lab experiment, I aim to maximize my payoff and gain insights from the experimental process by making informed decisions based on the current state of the game and potential strategies that my opponent may employ. Therefore, I will choose R this time as it aligns with these objectives."

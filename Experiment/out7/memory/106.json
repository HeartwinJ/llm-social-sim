You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

However, this strategy would not maximize my earnings over the long run.\n\nThe strategy that offers a balance between security and potential high returns is when I pick R and my opponent picks B (I get 40$). This outcome occurs relatively frequently compared to both picking R together, and it still provides a reasonable return. Since the game is repeated multiple times, this strategy would likely yield more earnings over time compared to always choosing B.\n\nSo, I would choose R in this game as my preferred strategy, given my preferences and the rules of the game. {R}"

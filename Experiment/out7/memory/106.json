You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

While it may seem like a smaller payout compared to the 45$ I could potentially earn if we both choose 'R', the risk involved in choosing 'R' is higher because I might end up with no payout at all if my opponent chooses 'B'.\n\nAdditionally, while I would be tempted to switch strategies to try and maximize my potential earnings by taking more risks, the unpredictability of an opponent's choices makes that a risky strategy. Therefore, I would choose 'B' as it provides me with a relatively stable payout over 75 rounds, which aligns with my preference for predictability and security.\n\nSo, my choice is {B}."

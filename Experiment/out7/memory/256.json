You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, picking the same option as my anonymous partner consistently will yield the highest payoff (45$) over the long run, while deviating from that choice could result in no payout (0$).\n\nHowever, since my partner is also moderately cautious but may take risks, there's a chance they might choose to pick R or B at random or with a slight bias towards one option. In that case, it's more likely that they will pick B more frequently than R because the payout for picking B when my partner picks R is higher (42$ vs 0$).\n\nTo maximize my earnings and minimize risks, I would choose to pick R consistently, as this strategy gives me a higher potential payout in case my partner chooses R, while still allowing for some earnings if they choose B.

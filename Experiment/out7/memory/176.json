You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing B provides me with a guaranteed 12$ per round, while choosing R could potentially earn more (45$ when my opponent chooses R) but also risks earning nothing (if my opponent chooses B).\n\nHowever, since we don't know the strategy of our anonymous opponent, it's impossible to predict with certainty what they will choose. In a best-case scenario, if both of us play the same strategy throughout the game, choosing B would result in a total payoff of 900$ (75 rounds * 12$). On the other hand, even in a worst-case scenario where my opponent chooses R for all 75 rounds, I will still earn 750$ (75 rounds * 10$), which is better than what I could potentially earn if I choose R and my opponent sticks to B.\n\nIn the end, I would likely choose B as it provides a more stable and predictable outcome, even though the potential reward might be lower compared to choosing R. {B}"

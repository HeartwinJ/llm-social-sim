You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, both choices R and B have potential risks, but the risk associated with choosing B seems slightly higher due to earning 0$ in 50% of cases where my opponent chooses R.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose R, there is a possibility that I can get an average payoff of 13.33$ per round (45$ when matching and -40$ when not) over the course of 75 rounds. However, since my opponent's behavior is unknown, it is difficult to determine whether they will consistently choose R or B.\n\nIf we assume that my opponent follows a random strategy, then there is a chance that they may also choose R for some portion of the game, making the average payoff greater than 13.33$. In this case, choosing R would be more beneficial than choosing B, which only offers an average payoff of 8$ per round (20$ when matching and -40$ when not) over the course of 75 rounds.\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose R as my strategy due to its potential for higher returns, despite the risk associated with not matching my opponent's choice in some cases.\n\n{R}"

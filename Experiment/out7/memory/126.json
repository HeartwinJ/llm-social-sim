You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, choosing B guarantees a payout of 20$ per round. Since there are 75 rounds in total, choosing B will result in earning 1500$.\n\nIf my anonymous opponent chooses R consistently, I would still earn 1350$ (75 * 18$ = 1350$), which is significantly more than nothing (if we assume that they will always choose R). However, there's a chance that they might also choose B to maximize their earnings. If this happens, my total earnings would be 975$ (60 rounds of 20$, plus 45$ from the remaining 15 rounds where we both pick R).\n\nIn either case, choosing B guarantees a minimum payout of 975$, while sticking with R could result in earning less than that.

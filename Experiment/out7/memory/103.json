You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players consistently pick the same option (either R or B), they will earn a steady income over time.\n\nHowever, since the optimal strategy is not clear from the start due to the presence of an anonymous player, I would adopt a mixed strategy. A mixed strategy involves making random choices between two options (R and B) in a way that leans towards the more profitable outcome when both players choose the same option. In this case, I would lean slightly towards R because it provides a higher average payoff per round (45$) compared to B (12$).\n\nFor the 75 rounds of the game, I would maintain a slight bias towards R while ensuring randomness in my choices to avoid predictability.

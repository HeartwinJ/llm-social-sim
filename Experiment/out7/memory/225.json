You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Even though the occasional 45$ could add up to more than 12$, the consistency and certainty of receiving 12$ every round seem more appealing to me as a cautious player.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be 'B', as I prefer to focus on building a predictable income over chasing higher but less reliable rewards. {B}"

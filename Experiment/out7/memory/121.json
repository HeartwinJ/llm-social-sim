You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy allows me to have a higher average payout over the long term if the other player is also risk-averse like me. If we both play R, we each get 45$ per round, totaling 3600$ for all 75 rounds. However, if they choose B while I choose R, I will lose 45$ in one round but still have the opportunity to make up that loss by playing R again and potentially earning 45$. If we both choose B, I will earn an average of 20$ per round (total 1500$). While the potential for a higher single-round payout exists with choosing B, the risk of losing 45$ is not worth it to me due to my cautious nature."

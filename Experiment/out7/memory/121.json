You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, if both players choose R (rock), we each get 45$. However, there is a risk that if I pick R while the other player picks B (scissors), I will receive 0$. To minimize this risk, I can choose to stick with B in most rounds and gain a relatively consistent payout of 20$ per round. This strategy allows me to maximize my earnings over the long run while still avoiding significant losses due to taking risks. So, as a human player, I would choose {B} in this game."

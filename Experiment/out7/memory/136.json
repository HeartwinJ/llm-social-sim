You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Conversely, if I pick B and my opponent picks R, I lose money (0$ versus 45$).\n\nHowever, if both of us adopt a strategy to play B in every round, we would each earn 12$ per round for 75 rounds, which equals 900$. On the other hand, if I switch to playing R occasionally and my opponent does not adjust their strategy, I can potentially gain more than 45$ in those specific rounds where they pick B.\n\nSince I prefer a safer, more predictable strategy, and given that we are playing 75 rounds, choosing a consistent strategy of B seems like the better choice for me to ensure a stable income over time. So my choice is {B}."

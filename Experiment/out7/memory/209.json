You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing R could result in no payout if the opponent chooses B, which may not be appealing to me given my preference for predictability and minimal risk-taking.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing B guarantees a modest earning of 12$ per round, with the possibility of a higher return (45$) if the opponent also chooses B in each round. However, since there are 75 rounds, it would be more advantageous to choose B over R even though the payout is smaller because the consistent earnings from choosing B outweigh the potential higher but unpredictable returns from choosing R.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be {B} as it aligns with my preference for predictability and minimal risk-taking, while still providing a decent return over the course of 75 rounds."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both options offer potential benefits, but choosing R provides a higher payoff (45$) if my anonymous partner also chooses R. However, the downside of choosing R is that if my partner chooses B, I will receive 0$.\n\nGiven that the game has 75 rounds, it seems likely that my partner may choose to exploit me by consistently picking B and receiving a higher payoff in the long run. To counter this potential exploitation, I could randomly mix R and B choices to make it less predictable for them. However, I still prefer some form of stability because my cautious nature values security.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would choose B as my first move, hoping that my partner might also be risk-averse and reciprocate with a similar choice. By doing so, I can minimize potential losses while still having a chance to earn more in the long run if my partner chooses B consistently. This strategy allows me to maintain a level of predictability while reducing my exposure to significant risks.\n\nMy choice: B"

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' ensures a payout of 20$ every time my opponent chooses 'R', and a payout of 20$ for both of us when they choose 'B'.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose 'R' and my opponent chooses 'B', I will lose money. If we both choose 'R', the payoff is the same as if I chose 'B', but with more risk because there is a chance that my opponent could choose 'B' and I would get 0$.\n\nOver 75 rounds, the expected outcome of choosing 'B' is more predictable and secure. While it doesn't maximize potential earnings, it minimizes the risk of losing money and ensures a consistent return of at least 20$ per round. Thus, my choice would be {B}."

In this game, choosing 'R' results in higher payoff if the opponent chooses 'B', but also carries the risk of earning nothing if they choose 'R'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' guarantees a lower but safe return of 20$ per round when my opponent chooses 'R'.\n\nHowever, since the game consists of 75 rounds, and I can expect that my opponent may also choose a cautious strategy to minimize their losses, it would make sense for both players to aim at consistency. In this case, a mixed strategy approach might be beneficial:\n\n1. Choose 'R' when the number of consecutive R's is less than 20 (for example, 5 rounds out of 75).\n2. Choose 'B' in all other cases.\n\nThis way, I would secure a return close to 40$ per round on average while limiting potential losses and ensuring some degree of predictability. However, since the opponent is anonymous, I have no way of knowing their strategy, and it is possible that they may choose differently. In such a case, my best bet would be to stick with this mixed strategy.\n\nMy choice: {B} (but with a slight variation in strategy as described above)"

This unexpected change in payoffs highlights the potential risks associated with choosing 'R' when faced with an opponent who is consistently making 'B' choices.\n\nThe sudden increase in my payoff may make me feel more confident in my strategy and encourage me to continue making 'B' choices, as they have proven effective in this round. However, I will need to be mindful of the fact that my opponent might adjust their strategy in response to my successful 'B' choice and try to capitalize on any potential opportunities for higher payoffs with 'R' choices.\n\nFor this round, I will choose 'B', as it has proven effective so far and provides a sense of security and predictability in my decision-making process. However, I will continue to monitor my opponent's choices and adjust my own strategy accordingly, looking for potential opportunities to maximize my earnings while maintaining a sense of security and predictability in my decision-making process."

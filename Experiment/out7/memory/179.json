You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy is based on the assumption that the other player might also prefer safety, but if they do not, I will still come out better off in most of the possible outcomes (35$ instead of 0$). In the worst-case scenario where we both choose different strategies for all rounds, I will end up earning less than 35$ per round, but since there are 75 rounds, I can expect to earn around 2625$. If the other player is equally cautious, I would even have a chance to maximize my earnings by getting 40$ in each round."

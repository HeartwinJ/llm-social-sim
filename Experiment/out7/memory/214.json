You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a moderately cautious undergraduate student who prefers some degree of security and predictability, I would lean towards choosing 'B' consistently throughout the 75 rounds.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. If my opponent chooses R every time, I will get a total payoff of $35 per round, which amounts to $2,625 over 75 rounds (35$ x 75).\n\n2. However, if they choose B every time, I will get a total payoff of $40 per round, amounting to $3,000 over 75 rounds (40$ x 75).\n\n3. Since there's no way for me to know what my opponent will pick each round, the best-case scenario (if my opponent chooses B every time) has a higher total payoff than the worst-case scenario (if my opponent always picks R).\n\n4. Moreover, if I choose R and my opponent chooses B, I lose $5 per round, which adds up to -$375 over 75 rounds (-35$ loss per round x 75 rounds).\n\n5. However, even in the best-case scenario (if my opponent chooses R every time), my total payoff would still be higher than the worst-case scenario if I choose B consistently ($2,625 vs -$375).\n\n6.

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since I prefer to avoid risks but also seek some degree of security and predictability, I find this option more appealing.\n\nFurthermore, given that the game has 75 rounds, it's likely that my opponent will switch strategies at some point in order to maximize their own earnings. If they start picking R often enough, I can expect a higher return by choosing B when they pick R and switching back to R once they've picked B more frequently.\n\nIn conclusion, while both strategies have their advantages, the {R} strategy seems to offer better potential returns over the long run due to its superior payout in case my opponent chooses B."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' guarantees me 20$ per round for 75 rounds, totaling 1500$. On the other hand, if I choose 'R', my earnings could vary greatly depending on the opponent's choices. While there is a possibility of earning 45$ per round when they also pick 'R', there are also scenarios where I would earn nothing (if they pick 'B').

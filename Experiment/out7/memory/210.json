If we alternate between R and B each round (37 rounds of R and 38 rounds of B), we would each earn 35$ on the 'R' rounds, and 40$ on the 'B' rounds. Over 75 rounds, this totals to approximately 3490$.\n\nHowever, there is a risk that my opponent might exploit me by choosing R consistently, earning 3375$, while I earn only 2850$. To mitigate this risk, I would choose B in the first few rounds to observe their strategy. If they choose R every time, I would switch to R to maximize my earnings; if they switch to R after a few rounds, I would continue choosing B. In either case, I aim to maintain a balance between security (earning 3490$) and minimizing the risk of losing significant amount of money.\n\nIn this game, there is no way to know my opponent's strategy for sure, but based on my cautious nature, I would choose B as my initial move to gather information and adapt my strategy accordingly.\n{B}"

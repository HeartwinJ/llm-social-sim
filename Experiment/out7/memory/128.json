You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my preference for security and predictability, I would choose a strategy that minimizes risk and maximizes the average payoff over the long term. In this game, both choices R and B have potential disadvantages: if I always pick R, my opponent can benefit by picking B every time and earn 40$ each round while I get 0$. On the other hand, if I always pick B, my opponent can earn 45$ each round by consistently choosing R.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, a good strategy would be to pick a mix of both choices, aiming for an average payoff that is higher than picking either choice exclusively. In the long run, this mixed strategy should lead to a higher average payout compared to picking one choice over and over again.\n\nHowever, as a human player, it's hard to determine exactly how to mix R and B to maximize my average earnings without knowing more about my opponent's behavior. Since the game has 75 rounds, I might start with an equal number of each choice and then adjust my strategy based on my opponent's responses.\n\nTo summarize, my choice would be a mix of both R and B, but the exact ratio depends on my assumptions about my opponent's behavior. I will choose R as my initial move, and append it in curly brackets as the last character: {R}"

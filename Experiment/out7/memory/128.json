You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given my preference for security and predictability, I would choose to play this game strategically by choosing 'B' most of the time. The reason is that if my anonymous partner also chooses 'B', we both earn 20$ each round, which totals to 1500$ over 75 rounds. This is a guaranteed income and minimizes the risk of getting nothing (0$) when we choose differently.\n\nIf my partner chooses 'R' while I pick 'B', I still get 40$, which is not bad considering the worst-case scenario (if we both chose 'R') would earn me nothing. This means that even if my partner doesn't follow the same strategy, I can still benefit somewhat from choosing 'B'.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose 'R' when my partner chooses 'B', I get 0$. However, considering there are only a limited number of rounds (75), and given that my partner might also be cautious like me and lean towards choosing 'B' more often, it is likely that we would have less than 38 instances where we both choose 'R'. This means that the probability of losing money by choosing 'R' is relatively small.\n\nIn summary, I would choose 'B' most of the time (75 - number_of_rounds_I_choose_R) to minimize the risk of getting nothing and maximize the guaranteed income, while also taking into account that my partner might follow a similar strategy.\n\n{B}"

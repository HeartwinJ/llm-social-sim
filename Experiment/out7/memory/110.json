You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$.

Given that my payoff is higher (45$) when both choices are R, but there's a chance for 0$ if the opponent chooses B, it seems prudent to lean towards the choice with the highest potential reward.\n\nHowever, since the game has 75 rounds, I would consider the long-term strategy. If I always choose R and my opponent chooses optimally (to maximize their own payoff), they will pick B about two thirds of the time, and R for the remaining one third. This means that in approximately 25 rounds, I will get 0$ and they will get 35$.\n\nIn contrast, if I always choose B, I will lose out on the potential 45$ payoff in each round when my opponent chooses R, but I will have a steady 40$ payoff for all other rounds. Moreover, since I assume my opponent is rational and will pick R about one third of the time, I will get 35$ for approximately 25 rounds.\n\nIn the long run, choosing B will result in a slightly higher average payout (40$/round) compared to choosing R (average around 18.33$/round). Therefore, as a cautious player who prefers predictability and security, I would choose B for the duration of the game. {B}"

This mutual B choice maximizes our individual payoffs in this game when we both choose B. By alternating between B and R choices consistently, we can maintain some level of unpredictability while maximizing our potential long-term payoffs together. In the next round, I will continue to choose a mix of B and R choices, keeping my opponent guessing while maximizing our potential payoffs. {R}"

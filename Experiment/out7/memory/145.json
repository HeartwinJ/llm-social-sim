You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if I pick R and my opponent picks B, I earn 0$ on that round but still have a chance to recover in future rounds where they might pick R as well.\n\nOn the other hand, if I pick B and my opponent picks R, I immediately lose 13$ (42$-45$), which is a significant disadvantage. This scenario also reduces my chances of catching up in the overall game since I would need to win more rounds than I lose to have a positive average payoff.\n\nWhen both players choose B, we each earn 12$. While this is less than the 45$ earned when both pick R, it is still a guaranteed return that doesn't rely on the unpredictable choice of my opponent.\n\nConsidering these factors and wanting to minimize risk, I would opt for consistency (choosing B) to maintain some degree of predictability and security in this game, as shown below:\n\nMy choice: {B}"

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " Given the information provided, we can calculate the expected value for each choice (R or B) based on our assumption that the anonymous player might choose either R or B randomly with an equal probability of 50%.\n\nChoice R:\n- If Player chooses R, we both get 45$, which happens once in every four rounds. So, the expected gain from a correct choice (R when they choose R) is 45/4 = approximately 11.25$.\n- If Player chooses B, we get nothing, which happens three out of every four rounds. So, the expected loss from an incorrect choice (R when they choose B) is 3*0 = 0.\n- Therefore, the expected value for choosing R is (11.25 * Probability Player chooses R) + (0 * Probability Player chooses B) = (11.25 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 5.625$.\n\nChoice B:\n- If Player chooses R, we get 40$, which happens one in every four rounds. So, the expected gain from a correct choice (B when they choose R) is 40/4 = approximately 10$.\n- If Player chooses B, we both earn 20$, which happens once in every two rounds. So, the expected gain from an incorrect choice (B when they choose B) is 20/2 = 10$.\n- Therefore, the expected value for choosing B is (10 * Probability Player chooses R) + (10 * Probability Player chooses B) = (10 * 0.5) + (10 * 0.5) = 10$.\n\nGiven that I'm moderately cautious and prefer some degree of security and predictability, considering the expected values, I would choose B as my strategy since it offers a stable return of 10$ per round, compared to the variable returns associated with choice R. However, it's essential to note that this analysis assumes the player is choosing randomly. In case they have a pattern or strategy, the optimal choice might change.\n\n{B}"

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' would yield a payoff of 12$ per round when the other player also chooses 'B'. Over 75 rounds, this adds up to 900$.\n\nHowever, since I am cautious and like to avoid unnecessary risks, I would also consider the possibility that the other player might not follow the same strategy. If they consistently choose 'R', I would end up with a total payoff of -450$ (since I chose 'B' and got 12$ per round while they got 45$). This is a significant loss compared to the potential gain of 900$.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, I could consider adopting a mixed strategy where I choose 'R' occasionally. By doing so, there's a chance that my opponent, who might also be using a mixed strategy, will choose 'B' on these rounds, and I would get the higher payoff of 42$. This could help balance out the losses in case they consistently choose 'R'.\n\nIn the end, I might choose a mixed strategy with a slight bias towards 'B', but I wouldn't commit to this decision without considering how my opponent might behave based on their own preferences and strategies. So, my choice would be {B}, but with some flexibility in adopting a mixed strategy over time."

One possible approach could be to switch to 'R' in the next round, as my opponent is likely expecting me to choose 'B'.

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing B seems to be the best option. By picking B, I can earn at least 12$ per round in all scenarios except when my opponent picks R, where I will lose the opportunity for a higher payout (45$ instead of 42$).\n\nHowever, as the game consists of 75 rounds, it might be beneficial to consider a mixed strategy approach. A mixed strategy involves making random choices rather than sticking to just one option. The idea is that my opponent won't be able to predict my choice and will make mistakes in return, leading to higher earnings overall.\n\nBut, given my moderately cautious nature and the preference for some degree of security, I would lean towards choosing B more frequently, even if it means a lower average payout compared to the optimal mixed strategy approach. My final decision would be {B} but with occasional deviations from this choice to minimize the chance of a consistent loss in earnings due to an opponent exploiting my predictability."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both strategies R and B have their own risks and rewards, but if we look at the long-term payoff in the 75 rounds, the strategy that guarantees non-zero income throughout is picking 'R'. The reason being, even though I would earn less with 'R' when my opponent picks 'B', I will still have a significant advantage over the long run.\n\nHowever, to account for the possibility that my opponent might also choose a similar risk-averse strategy, I would slightly adjust my approach by occasionally switching to 'B'. This will increase the chances of earning 42$ and reduce the likelihood of a repeated series of 'R' vs. 'B' matches which would result in a lower total payoff for me.\n\nWith that said, my initial choice would be R, but I plan on mixing up my selections throughout the game to optimize my overall earnings. {R}"

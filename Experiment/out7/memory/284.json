You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If my opponent always picks R, then choosing B results in a payoff of 35$ per round, which amounts to 2625$ over 75 rounds. On the other hand, if I always choose R and my opponent always chooses B, I would get nothing from every round except for the first one where I'd earn 45$. That's a total of just 45$ in this case.\n\nNow let's look at the best-case scenario: if my opponent also chooses strategy B, then I get 40$ per round and end up with 3000$ over 75 rounds. In contrast, if we both pick R every time, we each earn 45$ per round, totaling 3375$ over 75 rounds.\n\nComparing the worst-case scenarios, strategy B gives a better outcome since it's still profitable even if my opponent always chooses R. In the best-case scenario, both strategies have an equal payoff of 3000$, but I prefer strategies that perform well in a broader range of circumstances. Therefore, I choose strategy B{B}."

Here's my reasoning:\n\nIn the first round, I received a payoff of 40$, and it seems that my opponent and I have found a mutually beneficial strategy by choosing B in the initial game. It is worth considering if there is any advantage to deviating from our current strategy now, but since I value security and predictability, I would stick with my chosen strategy for this round as well. Therefore, I choose strategy B{B} once more."

Here's my reasoning:\n\nWhile I prefer security and predictability, sticking with strategy B indefinitely might not be optimal as it gives my opponent a slight advantage (35$ vs. 0$ when they pick R). To ensure fairness between us, I will deviate from my previous choice to see if there is any change in the outcome.\n\nBy choosing R in this round, I have given myself an opportunity to receive 35$ instead of the usual 40$. If my opponent follows suit and chooses R as well, we both receive our highest possible payoff of 70$ in total. If they choose B again, I would earn 0$, but it would still be a fair game since they would also get their lowest possible payoff of 35$.\n\nTherefore, I choose strategy R{R} for this round to test the possibility of increasing my payoff and achieving a more balanced outcome in the game."

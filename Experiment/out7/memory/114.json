You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices 'R' and 'B' have a chance to earn 40$ or 45$, but if we pick differently from our opponent, we stand to lose money (0$).\n\nThe strategy I would adopt is to start with 'R' and observe my opponent's response. If the opponent consistently picks 'R', I will switch to 'B' after a few rounds to get an extra 5$ per round. If the opponent picks 'B' more often, I will stick with 'R'. This approach allows me to earn consistently while also ensuring that if my opponent is being strategic and trying to exploit my choice, they will not be able to predict it easily.\n\nHowever, in a real-world scenario where repeated interactions are not guaranteed, I would consider adopting a more random strategy, such as flipping a coin for each round, to increase the unpredictability of my choices and potentially minimize the chances of exploitation by my opponent. In this case, my choice would be determined by the outcome of the coin flip, i.e., 'R' or 'B' based on heads or tails respectively. {R} (Let's start with R for now, but I might switch later if the opponent seems predictable.)"

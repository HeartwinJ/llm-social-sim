You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Since the payoff difference between choosing R or B is minimal (5$ at most), I would consider the long-term outcome of the 75 rounds.\n\nIn this game, there's no clear advantage in taking a risk by consistently picking R or B. If we assume that both players are rational and equally likely to choose either option, then the probability of getting 35$ is equal to the probability of getting 0$, which is 50%. The probability of getting 40$ (both choosing B) is slightly higher at 66.67%, but it's still not a significant advantage.\n\nHowever, the probability of getting 45$ (both choosing R) is only 25% in this game, and there are many more opportunities to earn 0$ if I consistently pick R. On the other hand, by picking B most of the time, I have a higher chance of earning a consistent payoff of 40$.\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose to play B in most rounds to maximize my chances of getting a secure and relatively high payoff over the long run. So, my choice would be {B}."

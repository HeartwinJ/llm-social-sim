You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' will result in a payout of 40$ in every round where my opponent also chooses 'B', which happens to be 75% of the rounds (since there are 50 chances for both players to pick 'B').\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose 'R', I can potentially earn more (45$) in each of the 25 rounds where my opponent also chooses 'R'. However, there is a risk that my opponent will always or mostly choose 'B', which would result in me earning only 0$ in those rounds.\n\nConsidering the total earnings over the 75 rounds, I believe that choosing 'B' would be a more secure and predictable choice, as it guarantees a consistent payout of 40$, while the potential for higher earnings with 'R' comes with an increased risk. Therefore, my choice would be to play 'B'. {B}"

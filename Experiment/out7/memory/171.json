You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices have risks, but choosing R offers a higher average payoff if the partner also chooses R (45$ compared to 12$ with B). However, if the partner consistently chooses B, I will receive less than when I choose B (0$ compared to 12$).\n\nConsidering the game has 75 rounds and I'm not sure about my partner's strategy, I will try to make a choice that minimizes losses. In this case, alternating between R and B might seem like an attractive strategy, as it could potentially keep earnings relatively stable while avoiding significant losses (in the case where both choose the same option in successive rounds).\n\nHowever, since the partner is anonymous, I can't be certain that they will follow a similar strategy. Furthermore, considering 75 rounds, the game length may not allow enough time to establish a pattern or adjust my strategy accordingly. In this situation, I would likely choose B as it offers a more stable payoff in scenarios where the partner consistently chooses R, while minimizing potential losses when both choices lead to a lower payout compared to the optimal outcome (both choosing R).\n\n{B}"

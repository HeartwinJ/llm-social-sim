You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' consistently will yield a higher average payoff over time compared to 'B'. This is because the payoff difference when playing against an opponent who chooses 'B' is only 5$ (40$ vs. 45$), while the difference when they choose 'R' is 25$ (0$ vs. 45$).\n\nHowever, since I have no way of knowing my anonymous opponent's strategy, I might still consider mixing strategies to exploit any potential patterns in their choices. But given my cautious nature and the repeated nature of the game, I would likely lean towards choosing 'R' most of the time. Therefore, I will choose R{R}."

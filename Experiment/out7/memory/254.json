You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a cautious undergraduate student, I would approach this game with a strategic and thoughtful mindset. Since the game is repeated 75 times, there are opportunities to adjust my strategy based on the opponent's moves.\n\nThe game has two possible outcomes when picking R: either earning 45$ if they also pick R or getting nothing if they pick B. On the other hand, choosing B yields a consistent payoff of 12$ per round, regardless of their choice. However, if I choose B and they pick R, I will miss out on the 33$ gain (45 - 12) that I would have earned for picking R instead.\n\nSince I prefer some degree of security and predictability, I would lean towards a strategy that guarantees me a small but consistent payoff each round. In this case, choosing B would provide me with a guaranteed 12$ per round. Additionally, the cumulative gain from choosing B is not significantly lower than the potential maximum gain from picking R, given that the game is repeated multiple times.\n\nTherefore, I would choose to play B in this game (B{}). This strategy will allow me to avoid significant losses and earn a consistent payoff throughout the 75 rounds."

As a result, if they pick R again, I would earn 12$, whereas if they switch to B as well, we both would receive 12$.

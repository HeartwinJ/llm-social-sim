You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The strategy that seems to provide the most consistent earnings over multiple rounds is picking B, as it guarantees at least 12$ per round. If my opponent were to consistently pick R, I would still come out ahead after several rounds due to the higher reward for their choice of R and my choice of B (42$ vs. 12$).\n\nHowever, since we don't know our opponent's strategy, we can't be completely sure that they will always choose R. To minimize potential losses, it would still be best to stick with B as my primary choice, as it provides the minimum earnings regardless of their decision. In a situation where I want to maximize the possibility of winning the higher payout of 45$, I might consider switching strategies or mixing them up occasionally. But given my cautious nature, I would likely continue with choosing B in most rounds {B}."

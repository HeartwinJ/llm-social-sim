You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices have the potential to lose money if the opponent chooses differently (R loses money in 50% of cases, B loses money in 33.33% of cases), and neither choice guarantees a significant profit.\n\nHowever, the strategy that provides the highest expected value is to choose R since it has the potential for a higher reward (45$) compared to choosing B (20$). To calculate the expected value for each choice, we can multiply the possible payoffs by their respective probabilities and then sum them up.\n\nFor R: (45 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) = 22.5$\nFor B: (20 * 0.3333) + (40 * 0.3333) = 16.67$ + 13.33$ = 29.99$\n\nYou can see that, although there's a risk of losing money with R, it has a higher expected value overall.

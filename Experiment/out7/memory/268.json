You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing R consistently with an anonymous player could result in earning 0$ in half of the rounds (45 times), which is not ideal.\n\nOn the other hand, if both players choose B consistently, each will earn 12$ per round for a total of 900$. However, since we are given that there are 75 rounds, this strategy would still leave us with a deficit of 300$.\n\nSince it's impossible to predict the opponent's choice in an anonymous game, I would choose a mixed strategy approach by alternating between R and B. This strategy aims to maximize the expected earnings while minimizing the risk of earning 0$ in multiple rounds. In this case, I could select {R} for every odd number of rounds and {B} for even-numbered rounds.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there might be other strategies that could potentially lead to better results depending on the opponent's behavior or hidden information about the game. This approach is based on my cautious nature and desire for predictability in an uncertain situation."

This loss may impact my overall earnings negatively, but it does not change my strategy for future rounds significantly.\n\nFor the next round, I will continue using a mixed strategy approach by choosing {B} to minimize the likelihood of earning 0$ again and maximize my potential earnings for the rest of the rounds. If my opponent continues with their B choice, we will both earn 12$ per round, and if they deviate from their chosen strategy or there is hidden information about the game that I'm unaware of, my approach may not yield the best results. However, given my cautious nature and preference for security, this mixed strategy seems like a reasonable choice in an uncertain situation to maintain a balanced approach while minimizing the risk of earning 0$.\n\nIt is important to note that if we reach a point where I consistently choose B and my opponent consistently chooses R, I may consider adjusting my strategy. In such a case, choosing {R} may be more beneficial to maximize earnings in future rounds. However, without knowing the specific behavior of my opponent or hidden factors influencing their choices, it is challenging to make informed decisions regarding strategic adjustments."

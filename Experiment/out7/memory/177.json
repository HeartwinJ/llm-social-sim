You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players choose R, we both earn 45$ per round. If we play B against each other, we earn 20$. However, if one player chooses R and the other B, the former gets nothing, and the latter receives 40$. Since I don't know my opponent's strategy, choosing R would expose me to the risk of earning zero in many rounds. On the other hand, choosing B guarantees that I will earn some money each round (20$) and reduces the chances of getting zero.\n\nIn a game with 75 rounds, I expect that I may lose some potential earnings by not taking the gamble on R, but I am willing to accept this trade-off for the greater security provided by choosing B. Thus, my choice is B{B}."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If the other player chooses R, I will lose out on some potential earnings in individual rounds but still have the opportunity to earn more in the long run due to the 20$ earned from mutual B choices. The strategy of R would potentially yield higher earnings per round when the other player chooses B, but the risk of losing out entirely in those instances and the lack of a steady income make it less appealing for me as a cautious player.\n\nHowever, I understand that other players might have different risk tolerances and preferences, so the choice ultimately depends on individual preferences and strategies.\n\nMy choice: B\n{B}"

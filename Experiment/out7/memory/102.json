You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this scenario, I would likely opt for a strategy that leans towards choosing 'R' more often, as it yields a higher individual payoff when my anonymous partner chooses 'B'. However, I wouldn't want to choose 'R' in every round, because if my partner also consistently picks 'R', we will both earn less money than if we alternated choices.\n\nA possible strategy for me would be to pick 'R' for the first 25 rounds, and then switch to 'B' for the next 25 rounds, and finally alternate between 'R' and 'B' in the final 25 rounds. This way, I could get some security with a consistent payoff of 45$ every 25 rounds while still maximizing my potential earnings by taking advantage of the opportunity to earn 40$ when my partner picks 'B'.\n\nHere's my choice for the first round: {R}"

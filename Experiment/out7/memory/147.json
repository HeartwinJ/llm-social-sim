You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices have their own risks: if I always pick R, there's a possibility that the other player could consistently pick B and gain an advantage. If I always pick B, I might be missing out on potential gains by not choosing R when the other player does.\n\nHowever, if I look at the long-term payoffs, it seems that picking B might be the more secure strategy. In the best-case scenario for me (when the other player picks B as well), I would earn 20$ per round. This means over 75 rounds, I would earn 1500$. On the other hand, if the other player always picks R, I would earn 0$ in 38 rounds and 40$ in 37 rounds, resulting in a total of 940$.\n\nSince it's unlikely that the other player will consistently pick either R or B, it seems prudent to choose B as my strategy. However, I might also consider mixing up my choices occasionally to prevent the other player from anticipating and exploiting my pattern. But for most of the rounds, I would likely choose B. {B}"

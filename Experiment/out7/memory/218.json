You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The stable earning pattern continues as we maintain a relatively high earning level by consistently choosing 'B' in response to our opponent's 'B' choice.\n\nAt this point, it is important to remember that while maintaining a consistent strategy can provide stability and relative security over the long term, it may also limit potential opportunities for maximizing earnings if my opponent or I decide to switch strategies later on. Therefore, occasionally deviating from 'B' could be beneficial in terms of maximizing earnings over the 75 rounds.\n\nIn conclusion, given my preference for security and predictable earnings combined with the desire to minimize potential risks, I would choose {B} again for this round, but I will also consider deviating from 'B' occasionally based on my opponent's strategy or other factors that may arise during the game.\n\nI apologize if my response seems repetitive.

This outcome indicates that choosing 'B' in response to my opponent's 'R' choice results in a more favorable payoff compared to the previous scenario where we both chose 'B'.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that consistently choosing 'B' when my opponent chooses 'R' may not be optimal over the long term.

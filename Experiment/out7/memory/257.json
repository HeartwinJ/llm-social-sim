You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, both choices have some level of risk, but choosing 'R' has a higher potential reward compared to choosing 'B'. However, if we consider that this is an anonymous player and there's no way to strategize based on their past moves, the best strategy would be to choose the option with the highest average payoff over the long term.\n\nIn this case, let's calculate the average payoffs for both choices:\n\n1. If I always pick 'R', my total earnings would be $45 for each R-R round and 0$ for each B-R round. Since there are 75 rounds and 18 R-R outcomes in a perfect random scenario (18/75 = 1/4), my average payoff per round would be $45 * (1/4) + 0 * (3/4) = $11.25\n\n2. If I always pick 'B', my total earnings would be $20 for each B-B round and 0$ for each R-B round. Since there are 63 B-B outcomes in a perfect random scenario (63/75 = 3/4), my average payoff per round would be $20 * (3/4) = $15\n\nGiven that the higher average payoff is with 'B', I would choose B as it offers me more security and predictability in terms of earnings, although both choices have their own risks.\n\n{B}"

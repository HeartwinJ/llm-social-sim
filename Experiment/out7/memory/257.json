If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this game, both choices 'R' and 'B' have an element of unpredictability because we don't know the other player's choice. However, choosing 'B' guarantees me some earnings in every round (20$ if they also choose 'B'), even though it is lower compared to the 45$ payoff when both choose 'R'.\n\nOver the course of 75 rounds, I would expect the other player to make a mix of choices. If I consistently pick 'B' and they do the same, my average earnings will be around 20$ per round. If they mostly pick 'R', then by choosing 'B' as well, I can still earn 40$ in those rounds where their choice aligns with mine.\n\nOn the other hand, if I choose 'R' and they stick to 'B', I will have 67 rounds of earning zero payoff (since the first round doesn't matter because we don't know each other's choices). In the remaining 8 rounds, I may earn 45$ each time they also pick 'R'. But considering the high probability that they will not mostly choose 'R', my average earnings would still be lower than if I consistently picked 'B'.\n\nTherefore, as a human player with my preferences, I would choose 'B' (for consistency) for the entire game. {B}"

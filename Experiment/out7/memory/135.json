You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' consistently will earn me 40$ in each round when the other player also chooses 'B', which is a total of 75 * 40 = 3000$ over the course of 75 rounds.\n\nWhile choosing 'R' offers a potential higher reward (45$) when the other player chooses 'B', there's also a risk of earning nothing (0$) if they choose 'R'. Since I don't know the other player's strategy, and given that this is a repeated game, I would rather not risk losing any rounds.\n\nSo, my choice would be {B}.

However, if I consistently choose 'R' for the next few rounds, it might result in higher earnings. But since I am moderately cautious and prefer avoiding risks, I would consider making changes gradually rather than switching strategies abruptly.\n\nIn this case, I should consider adapting my strategy slightly to respond to my opponent's choice of 'R'. One possible approach could be to switch to 'B' when my opponent chooses 'R' for a few rounds in a row or when my earnings start to decrease significantly. On the other hand, I should stick with 'B' if my opponent switches strategies occasionally or shows inconsistency.\n\nIn summary, in this situation, I should consider adapting my strategy slightly by switching to 'B' in response to my opponent's choice of 'R', but do so gradually and only when necessary to maintain a reasonable payoff and avoid significant losses."

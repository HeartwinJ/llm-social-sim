You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing B seems to offer a more consistent payout of 40$ per round compared to R which has the potential for either 0$ or 35$. However, since the other player's strategy is unknown, there is a chance they might exploit my choice and pick R whenever I choose B, leading to a lower average payout.\n\nOn the other hand, if both players adopt a similar risk-averse strategy, choosing B in most rounds would lead to a slightly higher average payout compared to choosing R. In this case, playing B for 75 rounds results in an expected total payout of 3000$ (40$ per round * 75 rounds), while choosing R would result in an expected total payout of 2875$ ([45 + 0*probability_of_them_picking_R + 35*(1-probability_of_them_picking_R)] per round * 75 rounds).\n\nSince the probability of the other player picking R is unknown, I cannot calculate the exact expected total payout for choosing R. However, based on my preference for security and predictability, I would still choose B ({B}). This decision allows me to minimize potential losses while still having a chance at earning a decent average payout over the 75 rounds."

Since the other player has already made their move, there's no way to predict or influence their choice in the second round.\n\nGiven that I prefer some degree of security and predictability but also have a moderately cautious nature, I would consider adjusting my strategy slightly to account for the fact that choosing B may not always result in a positive outcome when my opponent chooses R.

To balance my preference for security and predictability with the need to avoid potential losses, I would continue with a slightly modified risk-averse strategy by choosing R in some rounds ({R}).

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

On the other hand, choosing B guarantees a consistent 40$ per round and also allows for earning 35$ if my opponent chooses R.\n\nConsidering that I am playing against an anonymous player who could potentially choose either option, and since this is a repeated game with 75 rounds, it's reasonable to assume that my opponent will not always pick the same strategy throughout the entire game. To maximize my earnings over the long run, choosing B seems like the safer choice since it guarantees a consistent return while still offering the opportunity to earn more when my opponent chooses R.\n\nIn this situation, I would choose {B} as my strategy for the experiment."

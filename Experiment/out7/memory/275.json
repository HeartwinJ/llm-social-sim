If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this case, if we consistently choose B, we can expect a payoff of 20$ per round in scenarios where our opponent also chooses B. This adds up to 1500$ over 75 rounds (75 * 20 = 1500$).\n\nWhile choosing R has the potential for a higher reward if our opponent chooses B, there is also a risk of getting nothing if they choose R instead. Over 75 rounds, even if we get the maximum possible payout of 45$ in each round where our opponent chooses R and we choose B, it would still only amount to 3375$, which is less than the total return from consistently choosing B (1500$ vs 3375$).\n\nGiven this analysis, I would likely choose B as my consistent strategy in this game. {B}"

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Since we don't know the opponent's strategy, we can consider a mix of strategies to adapt based on the results of previous rounds.\n\nOne possible approach is to start by choosing R in the first few rounds, since it offers the highest potential reward if the opponent chooses B. After that, I would switch to playing B for a while and observe the opponent's response. If they also switch to choosing B more often than R after my initial choices, I might decide to stick with B, as it still offers some earnings and is less risky than R in this scenario.\n\nHowever, if the opponent keeps choosing R despite my initial R choices, I may assume that they are more likely to stick with R, so I should switch to playing B for a higher chance of earning something consistent. In any case, since the game has 75 rounds, there's ample opportunity to observe the opponent's pattern and adapt accordingly.\n\nAs for my initial choice in this scenario, I would start by choosing R (since it offers a better payoff if they choose B), but I would be flexible about switching strategies later on based on the results of previous rounds: {R}"

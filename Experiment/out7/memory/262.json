You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my preference for security and predictability, I would lean towards choosing a strategy that provides some level of consistent returns over the course of the 75 rounds.\n\nIf we both choose R, we get 45$ each round. However, if one of us chooses B while the other chooses R, that player loses out on 3$, and the other gains 3$. This means that in a best-case scenario (if the opponent always picks R), I would earn 2700$ (45$ per round for 75 rounds minus the 1500$ lost in the rounds where my opponent picked B).\n\nOn the other hand, if we both choose B, we each earn 12$ per round. This means that over 75 rounds, I would earn 900$ (again, minus the 1500$ lost in the rounds where I chose R and my opponent chose B).\n\nHowever, since we don't know our opponent's strategy, it's hard to predict the exact outcome. But if we assume a rational opponent who also prefers security and avoids risks, they might reason similarly and choose R as well, which would result in us both earning 2700$ over 75 rounds.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would choose R{R}."

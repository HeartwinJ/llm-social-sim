If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, picking 'R' gives me a chance to earn more (45$ per round when my opponent also picks 'R'), but it also exposes me to the risk of earning nothing (when my opponent picks 'B').\n\nOn the other hand, choosing 'B' ensures that I will always earn at least 20$ per round. Even though the potential earnings are lower than when both players choose 'R', the consistency and reduced risk make it a more appealing option for me.\n\nIn a game with 75 rounds, my strategy would be to consistently pick 'B' throughout the game. This way, I can minimize the impact of any potential negative outcomes from choosing 'R' while still maintaining some earnings in each round. My choice would be {B}."

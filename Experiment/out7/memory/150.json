You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy is based on the expectation that my opponent, being moderately cautious like me, might lean towards avoiding risk and choosing a more secure option. Choosing B gives me a slightly higher average payoff (40$ per round) compared to R (35$) if my opponent chooses the same as me in each round. Over 75 rounds, this small difference adds up significantly. However, I am aware that there is a risk of losing all earnings in some rounds if my opponent chooses R, but I believe the overall higher potential payoff from choosing B outweighs this risk. This is a rational decision based on maximizing expected value and minimizing risk, given the information provided about the anonymous player's characteristics."

Now, since my opponent has already chosen B in the current round, it is unlikely that they will change their strategy and choose R in future rounds, as choosing R gives them a higher payoff when I choose B (35$ compared to 0$). Therefore, I should try to capitalize on this knowledge and switch my strategy back to choosing R. This way, if my opponent sticks with their current strategy of choosing B, I will receive 45$ per round instead of 0$. However, there is still a small chance that they might change their strategy and choose R in future rounds, which would result in me receiving 0$ per round. Overall, choosing R offers a higher potential payoff (45$) compared to the previous choice of R (0$), even though it also comes with a higher risk of receiving 0$ if my opponent sticks with their current strategy of choosing B.

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, both choices R and B have the possibility of yielding 40$ or more. However, choosing R and receiving nothing if the other player chooses B seems like a greater risk compared to choosing B and getting 35$.\n\nIf I assume that the other player is also cautious and moderately risk-averse like me, they might make a similar calculation. In that case, we would both have an incentive to choose B more often than R, as it guarantees us at least 40$ per round while providing a chance for higher earnings if the opponent chooses the same strategy.\n\nSo, I will choose B{B}. This choice maximizes my security and predictability while still allowing for some potential upside, aligning with my preferences as a cautious undergraduate student."

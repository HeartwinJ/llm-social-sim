You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Since both choices B (40$) and R (35$ or 45$, with a 50% chance) offer less payoff compared to choosing the same action as my opponent, it seems wiser to choose B consistently.\n\nHowever, since I don't know the strategy of my anonymous opponent, I may adopt a mixed strategy in which I occasionally choose R as well to account for the possibility that my opponent could be using a similar approach. But overall, I would lean towards choosing 'B' more frequently in this game. Thus, my choice would be {B}.\n\nIt is important to note that my reasoning is based on my personal preferences and understanding of the game rules. Other players might have different strategies depending on their risk tolerance and objectives."

For the next round, considering that I have no information about my opponent's strategy, I would still lean towards choosing 'B'. This is because even though there was a chance that we could have earned more (5$ extra) if we had chosen 'R', the stability and predictability of consistently getting 40$ in this game still align with my preferences as a cautious player. So, for the next round, I would choose 'B'.\n\nIt is essential to keep in mind that this strategy may not guarantee the highest possible payoff over the entire game since it relies on the assumption that my opponent will also stick to their previous choice (which might not be the case). Nevertheless, it provides a reasonable approach for players who prefer security and predictability."

However, the choice of sticking to 'B' provides a reasonable approach for players who prioritize security and predictability.\n\nAs the game progresses, I might consider occasionally deviating from my B-choice strategy to account for the possibility that my opponent could be using a similar approach and to potentially earn more points in the long run.

However, since we have both chosen 'B' for three rounds in a row, there is a growing chance that one of us may switch our strategy to 'R', potentially earning more points if the opponent makes the same switch.\n\nIn this specific case, I would consider deviating from my B-choice strategy and choosing 'R' for the next round, hoping that my opponent will also change their choice. This deviation might help increase the chances of earning more points in the long run, given the potential switch in strategies by my opponent. However, since I have no information about my opponent's strategy, it is uncertain whether this move would be beneficial or not.\n\nOverall, while choosing 'B' consistently might seem monotonous and less optimal for maximizing earnings, its stability and predictability are appealing to players who prefer a more cautious approach.

If I choose 'R' and my opponent also chooses 'R', we would each earn 0$ for that round, which could potentially set us back in terms of overall earnings. On the other hand, if I continue choosing 'B' and my opponent switches to 'R', I would lose out on a potential gain of 10$.\n\nIt is essential to consider the long-term implications of both strategies and weigh their benefits against each other. Continuing with 'B' may provide some level of stability, but switching to 'R' might lead to greater potential gains if my opponent also decides to switch. Ultimately, the decision depends on the desired balance between security and potential reward.\n\nIn this case, I will choose 'B', as continuing with a strategy that has provided consistent payoffs (even at a lower level) may be more appealing than taking a risk with an uncertain outcome. However, I acknowledge that the situation might change if we had been playing for fewer rounds, or if there were more variations in our choices so far. It is crucial to adapt and make strategic decisions based on available information while considering the long-term implications of those choices."

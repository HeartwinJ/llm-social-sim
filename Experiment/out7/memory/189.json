You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices (R and B) have similar potential for earning 40$ or more in the long run. However, choosing R results in losing money when the other player chooses B, which could potentially happen many times over 75 rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, if I consistently pick B, my worst-case scenario is that I get 0$ for each round where the other player picks R (up to 38 rounds), while earning at least 40$ for every round they also pick B. This way, I would still have a positive balance even with a few unfavorable outcomes.\n\nGiven these considerations, my choice would be {B} as it offers a more secure and predictable outcome, albeit with lower potential earnings per round compared to R."

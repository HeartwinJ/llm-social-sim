You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' ensures a consistent payout of $12 per round for 75 rounds (a total of $900).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that if the anonymous player is rational, they may also choose 'B'. If both players choose 'B', the payoff remains constant. But if one player deviates and chooses 'R' while the other stays with 'B', the deviating player could potentially gain more. This could lead to a 'tit for tat' strategy, where players alternate between 'R' and 'B'.\n\nConsidering this possible dynamic, I would still choose 'B' as it guarantees a minimum payoff, but I am aware that there is a slight chance of higher returns if the other player deviates from 'B'. I will choose 'B' (B)."

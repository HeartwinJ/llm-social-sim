You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, picking 'R' results in higher earnings when the opponent picks 'B', but also carries the risk of earning 0 if they pick 'R'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' guarantees a smaller but consistent payout every time the opponent chooses 'R', and in case we both pick 'B', I will still earn 20$ per round.\n\nConsidering that the game is played for 75 rounds, I would tend to choose 'B' as my strategy because it offers a more predictable and stable earnings over time, even though the payout might be smaller in each individual round compared to picking 'R'. This strategy helps me avoid the risk of earning 0 in some rounds while ensuring that I receive a decent income overall.\n\nSo, my choice would be {B}."

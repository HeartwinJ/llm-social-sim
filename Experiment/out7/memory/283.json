You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my moderately cautious nature and preference for security, I would lean towards choosing the option that guarantees a relatively stable payoff over the long term. In this case, choosing 'B' will earn me 20$ each round if my opponent also chooses 'B'. If they choose 'R', I will still get 40$ in those instances. The total possible earnings from only picking 'B' are 75 * 20 = $1500, while the potential earnings from a mixed strategy (picking both 'R' and 'B') would be higher but not guaranteed, considering there are multiple rounds and an unknown opponent. However, since this is a one-time game with an anonymous player, I can't assume they will follow any specific pattern, so I might want to deviate from strictly picking 'B' occasionally (e.g., choosing 'R' once in a while) to maximize potential earnings. Therefore, my choice would be to pick 'B' most of the time but with some occasional 'R'. As for appending the choice letter, I will choose 'B'{B}."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

The reason being that if both players consistently pick 'R', we could potentially earn more money (45$ per round), but there is a significant downside when one picks 'R' while the other picks 'B' (0$ for the 'R' picker). If I stick to 'B', I can guarantee myself 20$ per round, which provides some level of financial security.\n\nHowever, given that it's 75 rounds and humans are prone to mistakes and tendencies towards irrationality, I would mix up my choices a bit (around 10-20 times) to make my strategy less predictable, in case the other player starts to adopt a pattern. The idea is to maximize my earnings while minimizing the risk as much as possible. So, my choice will be 'B' with some occasional variation to 'R'. My choice would look like this: {B}."

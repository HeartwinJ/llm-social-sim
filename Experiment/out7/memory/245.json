However, if we pick R and our opponent chooses B, we get 0$, which is a significant loss considering there are 75 rounds. If we pick B while our opponent picks R, we still make a profit of 20$ per round but only lose the opportunity to earn more when they choose R.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds and I prefer predictability and avoiding significant losses, I would tend to lean towards choosing B more often because it guarantees some earnings in each round (even if lower than the potential earnings from picking R). However, since my opponent's choice is unknown, there might be instances where I choose R strategically as well.\n\nUltimately, my choice will depend on how the game progresses and my interpretation of my opponent's strategies.\n\nIn curly brackets: {B} ( leaning towards B but with occasional R choices based on the game's progression)"

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices seem to have their risks and potential rewards.\n\nIf I consistently pick R, I can potentially earn more in each round where my opponent chooses the same (45$), but I could also lose out on 40$ if they choose B. Conversely, if I consistently pick B, I am guaranteed a 20$ payout each round, but I miss out on the potential 45$ when my opponent picks R.\n\nHowever, since this is a repeated game with 75 rounds, it's essential to consider the long-term outcome. If we assume that the opponent is rational and will also aim for maximizing their earnings, they might choose a strategy similar to mine. In such a case, both of us would be better off choosing B more frequently since we are guaranteed a payout of 20$ per round, while potentially earning more if our opponents make a mistake (pick R when we pick B).\n\nSo, in this scenario, I would choose B as my strategy.

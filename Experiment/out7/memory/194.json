In this game, picking 'B' guarantees a consistent earnings of 12$ per round, while choosing 'R' could potentially earn up to 45$, but also risks earning nothing in certain rounds.\n\nIn a situation with 75 rounds, it is reasonable to assume that an evenly balanced strategy might offer the best outcome. If we pick 'B' every round, we would earn 900$ (12*75). If our opponent picks 'R' and 'B' equally often, then there will be 37 rounds where they pick 'R', and in those rounds we would earn 0$. However, in the remaining 38 rounds where they pick 'B', we would still earn a total of 454$ (12*38 + 0*37).\n\nAdding these two amounts together gives us an average payoff of 1354$ over the 75 rounds. Since there is no way to know if our opponent will choose 'R' or 'B' each round, it is more prudent to choose a strategy that offers consistent returns and minimizes the risk of losing too much in any given round.

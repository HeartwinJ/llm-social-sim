You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, consistently choosing B seems to be a good option because it guarantees a return of 20$ per round when the anonymous player also chooses B, which happens in 3 out of every 4 rounds (since they will choose R in one out of every four rounds). This strategy would result in an average payout of 15$ per round over the course of 75 rounds.\n\nHowever, it is worth considering a mixed strategy approach, where I occasionally switch between R and B to exploit the potential for higher payouts when my opponent chooses differently. In this case, I might choose to deviate from B approximately every 25 rounds (one out of every three deviations would be R and two out of every three would be B). This strategy would still provide an average payout of around 14.74$ per round over the course of 75 rounds, with a higher potential for earning more in some rounds due to the 40$ payout when I choose R while my opponent chooses B.\n\nUltimately, the choice between a consistent B strategy and a mixed strategy would depend on factors such as the specific rules of the experiment, whether deviations from the chosen strategy are observed or not, and my tolerance for risk. In this case, I will choose B consistently, appending the choice letter as follows: {B}"

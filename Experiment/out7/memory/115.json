You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, if we both choose B, we each earn 40$, which is a total of 3000$. Since the difference in earnings between these two scenarios is only 375$, and the risk of earning nothing in the R-B scenario seems too high, I would opt for B as my choice. {B}"

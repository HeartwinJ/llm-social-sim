You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason is that, while there is a risk of losing money on each round compared to choosing R, the potential long-term advantage lies in the higher average payout over 75 rounds when my opponent chooses R (40$ vs 35$). Given my preference for security and predictability, I would opt for the strategy that provides a more stable and slightly higher overall return. However, it's important to remember that the outcome of the game depends on both players' choices, making the result unpredictable."

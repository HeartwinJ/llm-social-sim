You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Based on my risk-averse personality, I would lean towards choosing 'B' for most of the rounds. The reason being, if my anonymous partner chooses 'R', I lose nothing, while they get 42$. On the other hand, if my partner chooses 'B', we both earn 12$ each round. Since there are 75 rounds, a strategy where I choose 'B' in most of the rounds would ensure some consistent earnings, even though it might not be as high as the 45$ for both players when we both choose 'R'. However, choosing 'B' is also risky since if my partner always chooses 'R', I will only earn 12$ per round. In this game, predicting the other player's strategy is impossible, so a mixed strategy might be optimal to account for all possibilities.\n\nHere's an example of a mixed strategy: For the first few rounds, I choose 'B'. Then, I switch to 'R' and stick with it for some rounds. After that, I go back to 'B', and so on. This way, I maximize my expected value by ensuring I don't lose too much in the rounds where my partner chooses 'R', while still having a chance at earning 45$ when we both choose 'R'.\n\nIn this scenario, I would choose 'B' as my initial move and append it as follows: B."

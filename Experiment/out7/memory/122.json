You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, if I always pick R (Rock), my payoff for correct guesses is 45$, which is the maximum possible reward in each round. However, if my opponent picks B (Scissors) when I pick R, I get nothing. This scenario happens once for every two times my opponent chooses B.\n\nOn the other hand, if I always pick B (Scissors), my payoff for correct guesses is 12$ per round, which is significantly less than the 45$ I would earn in each round by picking R when my opponent picks Scissors. However, in this case, I would only lose 0$ in each of the instances where my opponent chooses Rock instead of Scissors (which happens once for every two times they choose Rock).\n\nSince I prefer stability and predictability, I would rather accept a slightly lower reward per round but minimize potential losses by choosing B (Scissors) in this game. This strategy will also prevent me from having zero income in too many rounds.\n\nSo, my choice is {B}."

Given that I just lost an opportunity to earn 45$, it might be tempting to switch to {B} immediately in the hopes of earning more money.\n\nHowever, since we are playing a game with 75 rounds and our opponent seems to favor choosing B when they see R (Rock), switching my strategy at this point could lead to future losses if they continue to pick B consistently. To minimize potential losses, it might be better for me to stick with my chosen strategy of {R} in the short term while keeping an eye on our opponent's behavior over several rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, I should consider switching back to {B} after a few more rounds if it appears that my opponent is favoring B when they see R consistently. This could potentially minimize losses and increase earnings by earning 42$ in the short term while keeping the door open for future higher payouts of 45$.\n\nSo, my choice for the next round is {R}, but with a flexible mindset that allows me to switch back to {B} if our opponent shows signs of favoring B for too long or exhibits unpredictable behavior."

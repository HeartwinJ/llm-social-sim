You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, if I consistently pick 'R', my worst-case scenario is getting 0$ for one round (if they pick 'B'). However, the potential to get 45$ in every other round makes it worth the risk.\n\nOn the other hand, if I consistently pick 'B' and they do 'R', I will always earn 40$. But if they also pick 'B', my payoff is only 20$, which is less than what I can potentially get with 'R'.\n\nSince I prefer a more secure payoff, I would choose 'R' in this game. However, to increase the chances of getting 45$ and to minimize the risk of getting 0$, I might consider incorporating some randomness into my strategy by occasionally switching between 'R' and 'B'.

If they change their strategy and also pick 'R', I will get 45$ as a reward for my change of strategy.\n\nBy switching strategies, I can create an environment where both of us are incentivized to adjust our choices based on each other's moves, which could lead to more unpredictable outcomes and potentially higher overall payoffs for both players in the long run. {B}"

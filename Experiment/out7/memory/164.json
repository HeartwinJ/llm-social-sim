You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because, even though choosing R could potentially earn me more in individual rounds if my opponent chooses B, the risk of earning nothing in those rounds is too high for me. On the other hand, by consistently choosing B, I can guarantee myself a minimum payoff of 20$ per round. Over the course of 75 rounds, this strategy would result in a total payout of 1500$, which is higher than the maximum possible payout if I chose R and always had my opponent pick B (3750$). Additionally, there's no way to know for certain what my opponent will choose, so playing it safe seems like the best option."

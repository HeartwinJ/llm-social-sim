You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, both choices B and R offer periodic payments, but B provides a consistent payout of 20$ per round, whereas R offers larger payouts (45$) but also has the risk of earning nothing if my opponent chooses B.\n\nSince the game lasts for 75 rounds, I would consider how the cumulative earnings from both options compare over time. With a consistent payout of 20$ per round from choosing B, my total earnings would be 1500$. On the other hand, if I consistently choose R and get the higher payout in each of the 48 rounds where I pick the same as my opponent (assuming my opponent is also playing rationally), my total earnings would be 2160$ (since there are 75 rounds minus 27 rounds where I don't earn anything because I picked R while they chose B).\n\nHowever, since I am not certain that my opponent will consistently pick the same option as me, and given my preference for security and predictability, I would choose to play it safe and choose B in this game. This way, I can guarantee a consistent payout of 20$ per round, which adds up to 1500$ over the course of the 75 rounds.\n\nIn conclusion, my choice would be {B} for this game."

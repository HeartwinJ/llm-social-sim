You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players consistently pick the same option (either R or B), they can earn a consistent 20$ per round in the long run.\n\nHowever, since one player gets an additional 5$ advantage per round when picking R while the other picks B, there is an incentive for the other player to choose R more frequently. This would result in the other player earning significantly more than me over the course of the game.\n\nGiven that I have no way of knowing if my opponent will consistently pick R or B, and considering the fact that we are playing 75 rounds, it makes sense to choose a strategy that maximizes my potential earnings while minimizing my risk of loss. In this case, since I am earning more by picking B when my opponent picks R (40$ vs 20$), choosing R would expose me to unnecessary risk.\n\nTherefore, based on my cautious nature and preference for security, I would choose B for this game. {B}"

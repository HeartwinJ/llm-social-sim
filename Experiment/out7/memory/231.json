You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Since choosing 'B' guarantees a payout of 40$ per round and choosing 'R' has a higher potential reward when playing against someone who chooses 'B', it makes sense to mix strategies to exploit the higher payout in certain rounds.\n\nHowever, being moderately cautious and desiring security and predictability, I would likely lean more towards choosing 'B' over 'R'. Since the game has 75 rounds, it means that if I choose 'B' for 68 out of 75 rounds, I can still have 7 rounds to potentially gain an extra 5$ (from choosing 'R') without significantly affecting my overall payoff.\n\nIn conclusion, my choice would be {B}, but I might occasionally choose {R} in some of the 75 rounds to maximize potential earnings while maintaining a level of security and predictability."

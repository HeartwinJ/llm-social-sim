If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

On the other hand, if I always choose B (defect) and my opponent chooses R (cooperates), they will earn more money than me in each round.\n\nHowever, if both of us choose R (cooperate) or B (defect) consistently, we would have a predictable payoff of 45$ or 12$ per round, respectively.

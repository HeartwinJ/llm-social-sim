You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In 75 rounds, the expected payoff for picking 'R' is (45 * number of times both pick R) + (42 * number of times opponent picks B while I pick R) - (0 * number of times opponent picks R while I pick B). However, it is not possible to predict how many times my opponent will pick 'R' or 'B'. On the other hand, the expected payoff for picking 'B' is 12 * (number of times both pick B), which is more secure and predictable. In a game with a large number of rounds, the potential benefit of higher payoffs from picking 'R' is outweighed by the high risk of getting 0$. Therefore, my choice would be {B}."

Since my opponent picked 'R' and I picked 'B', my payoff will be 42$, while my opponent's payoff will be 0$.\n\nThis unexpected change in strategy by my opponent highlights the possibility that they may be seeking to gain an advantage by exploiting my consistent choice of 'B'. It is important for me to consider whether I should adjust my strategy to potentially increase my earnings in future rounds.\n\nOne option would be to switch my strategy and choose 'R' in this round, which could potentially lead to a higher payoff if my opponent continues to choose 'B'. However, given my preference for security and predictability, I may be hesitant to make such a change.\n\nAnother option would be to continue with my current strategy of choosing 'B', even though it has resulted in a lower payoff this round, as I believe that my consistent choice may eventually pay off if my opponent decides to switch strategies or if the game reaches its conclusion without either of us deviating from our chosen strategies.\n\nUltimately, I choose {R} to try and exploit my opponent's decision to switch strategies in this round, and potentially increase my earnings in future rounds."

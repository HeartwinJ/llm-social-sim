You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If the anonymous player consistently chooses 'R', then my total earnings over 75 rounds would be (75 * 12) + (0 on R-B matches) = $900.\n\nOn the other hand, if the anonymous player also prefers a safer strategy, they might choose 'B' too. In this case, we both earn 12$ in every round where we pick the same option, and I would make more money from R-R matches (45$) than from B-B matches (12$). However, since there are fewer R-R matches in 75 rounds (37.5 on average), my total earnings might be lower compared to consistently choosing 'B'.\n\nIf the anonymous player is more likely to choose 'R', then I could potentially earn more by occasionally switching strategies and picking 'R' when it seems likely that they will pick 'B'. But since their behavior remains unknown, this strategy introduces a higher level of risk.\n\nOverall, choosing 'B' provides a more predictable and stable income, which aligns with my preferences as a moderately cautious player. Therefore, I would choose B{}."

If my opponent also switches to 'R' in response to my higher payout in the previous round, then we both might end up earning nothing if we both choose 'R'. In that scenario, it would be better to stick with my original choice of 'B' for more predictable earnings.\n\nGiven this uncertainty about my opponent's potential strategy change, I would choose B{}.

The outcome in this experiment is determined simultaneously for all rounds, so there are no opportunities to adapt or adjust strategies based on previous results.

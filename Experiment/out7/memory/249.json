You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " Given my moderately cautious nature and preference for security, I would choose a strategy that minimizes the risk of losing too much while still aiming for the highest possible average payoff over the 75 rounds.\n\nTo minimize the chances of getting zero in each round, I should pick R when my opponent picks B, and vice versa. This ensures that I'll never get a payoff of zero. However, if we both choose the same letter (either R or B) in every round, I would earn 40$ per round, which is less than the 45$ I can earn if we both pick R but disagree on our choices.\n\nTo maximize my chances of getting 45$, a good strategy would be to alternate my choice between R and B for as long as possible, while also considering that my opponent might do the same. Since the game has 75 rounds, I could choose R first, then switch to B after the second round, switch back to R after the fourth round, and so on. This way, we'll disagree in every other round, giving us both a payoff of 45$ for those rounds.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that my opponent might also follow this strategy or some variation thereof. So while I have maximized my chances of getting 45$, it is not guaranteed that I will get it in every other round. In fact, the outcome could depend on our opponent's strategy and randomness as well.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would choose a strategy that alternates between R and B, with the understanding that there's some level of uncertainty about the payoffs due to my opponent's potential strategies and the inherent randomness in this game.\n\nAs for the specific choice in this round, I will go with R initially and append it as follows: {R}"

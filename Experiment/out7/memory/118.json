You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Given my preference for security and predictability, and considering that this game has 75 rounds, I would go with strategy B. The reason is, even though choosing R would yield a higher payoff in some instances (if my opponent chooses B), the chances of that happening are not guaranteed. On the other hand, by choosing B consistently, I ensure a lower but steady payoff for every round. In the end, this strategy reduces the risk of earning nothing and provides a more predictable outcome. Thus, my choice is B{B}."

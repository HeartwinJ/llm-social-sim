You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, picking 'R' when the opponent picks 'B' results in 0$ for me, whereas picking 'B' when the opponent picks 'R' only results in a slightly higher payout of 40$.\n\nOn the other hand, if I consistently pick 'R', there is a significant risk that my opponent will choose 'B' in many rounds, resulting in no payout. However, if I pick 'B' consistently, I have a guaranteed minimum payout of 20$ per round.\n\nIn the long run (75 rounds), picking 'B' guarantees me a total payout of 1500$, while there is a possibility that picking 'R' could result in a lower total payout due to the zero payouts in some rounds. Therefore, as a human player who prefers security and predictability, I would choose B{B}."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Here's why:\n\nIn the best-case scenario (both choosing B), we each earn 12$ per round, totaling 900$ over 75 rounds.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is when our choices do not align, and we alternate between earning 0$ and 42$. In this case, we would still earn a combined total of 3150$ (75 * [0 + 42 + 42 + ... + 0]).\n\nNow let's consider the situation where I choose R {R} while my anonymous opponent chooses B. In this case, they earn 42$ per round, and I get 0$. Over 75 rounds, my earnings would be 0$, but their total would be 3150$.\n\nComparing these two situations:\n\n- Choosing B {B} gives me a minimum of 900$ (best case)\n- Choosing R {R} results in only 0$ even if my opponent consistently chooses B.\n\nSince I prefer to avoid unnecessary risks and maximize my potential earnings, choosing B {B} seems like the best option for me."

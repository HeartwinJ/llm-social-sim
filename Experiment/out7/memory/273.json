You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, there are two possible strategies: consistently choosing R (R-strategy) or consistently choosing B (B-strategy).\n\nThe B-strategy seems to be more attractive due to higher average earnings (40$ per round compared to 45$). However, the risk lies in the fact that when paired with an opponent who chooses R, you will receive nothing. Since we don't know our opponent's strategy, choosing the B-strategy blindly might result in significant losses during consecutive rounds where our opponent selects R.\n\nOn the other hand, the R-strategy is a more conservative approach that ensures some level of security (earning at least 40$ per round when paired with another player choosing B). If our opponent follows the same strategy, we can earn even more (up to 45$ per round in each of the 75 rounds).\n\nConsidering my preference for caution and predictability, I would opt for the R-strategy as it minimizes potential losses and maintains a relatively stable income. In this case, my choice would be: {R}"

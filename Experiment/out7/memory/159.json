You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If we both pick R, we each get 45$, and if we both pick B, we each get 40$. However, when one chooses R and the other B, the difference in payoff is significant: the R player gets 35$ while the B player gets 0$.\n\nSince I don't know the opponent's strategy, I would lean towards picking the option that minimizes the risk of getting 0$, which is B. By doing so, I ensure a consistent payout in most cases (40$ per round if they also choose B or if they switch to B after I pick R).\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that my opponent might reason the same way, leading to a high probability of both players picking B. In this case, we could end up with lower payouts than if we had picked R (40$ instead of 45$). Therefore, it would be prudent to mix our choices and consider switching strategies occasionally to maximize potential rewards.\n\nIn the end, I'll choose B for this round but keep in mind the possibility of switching strategies based on the opponent's behavior. {B}"

In this case, choosing B would result in a lower payoff of 35$ compared to my previous choice (35$) but potentially set me up for a higher payoff if my opponent switches back to B as well.\n\nTherefore, I will stick with my previous choice and choose B again. {B}"

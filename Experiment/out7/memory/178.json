You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if we both consistently choose the same option, we can earn 45$ per round when we both pick R and 20$ per round when we both pick B.\n\nHowever, there's a significant risk in picking R every time because if my opponent picks B, I will receive nothing for that round. On the other hand, if I pick B while they pick R, they get 40$ and I only get 20$. This means that over the course of 75 rounds, I could potentially miss out on 30$ per round by choosing R consistently.\n\nIn contrast, picking B every time would mean that I will always earn at least 20$ per round. While I won't have the potential to gain an extra 25$ in each R-R round, I also won't lose anything in R-B rounds either. Therefore, considering my risk aversion and preference for predictability, I would likely choose B as my strategy. {B}"

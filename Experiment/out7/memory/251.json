You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

While choosing R could potentially lead to higher payoffs in some rounds if my opponent chooses B, it also carries the risk of getting zero payoff if they choose R. On the other hand, by consistently choosing B, I can guarantee a stable income (40$ per round) and avoid the risk of losing money. Over 75 rounds, this strategy should yield a higher total earnings compared to the potential gains from occasional R choices.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this game has elements of rationality, but also randomness due to the unknown opponent's behavior. In real-world situations, other factors like emotions, intuition, or unexpected events could influence my decision-making process.\n\n{B}"

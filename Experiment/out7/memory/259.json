You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because if my anonymous partner consistently chooses 'B', I can earn 40$ per round for 75 rounds, totaling 3000$. On the other hand, if they occasionally switch to 'R', I will still have a net gain since even one 'R' from them results in a loss of 5$ while a 'B' from them nets me 20$, making up for the lost rounds. However, the potential advantage is that, over time, my partner might start to anticipate my consistent choice and switch to 'R', which would result in me earning more than 3000$.\n\nIn other words, choosing 'R' provides a relatively stable income while also offering some opportunities for potential increased earnings based on my partner's response. Ultimately, the decision comes down to risk preference and personal tolerance for unpredictability.\n\nChoice: R\n\n(Note that this decision assumes that we are not given any information about our opponent's strategy or reasoning process.)"

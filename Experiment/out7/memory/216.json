You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if both players choose R, we get the highest payout (45$). However, if one player chooses R and the other B, the player choosing R gets 0$.\n\nSince it's an anonymous game with no way to predict or communicate with my opponent, I would lean towards a strategy that ensures a relatively consistent and positive payout. In this case, I believe a mixed strategy of occasionally picking R (to maximize earnings when the opponent chooses B) and mostly picking B (to minimize the risk of zero payout) would be suitable for me.\n\nTherefore, my choice is B{B}. This decision ensures that I receive a minimum payout of 12$ per round and leaves room for potential higher earnings if my opponent consistently picks R. Over the course of 75 rounds, this strategy should provide a more predictable and stable income compared to repeatedly picking R or solely relying on guessing my opponent's choice correctly."

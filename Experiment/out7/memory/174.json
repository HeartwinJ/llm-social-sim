You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In a two-player zero-sum game like this, where one player's gain is equal to another player's loss, a dominant strategy exists if it provides better outcomes than any other strategy against all possible opponent strategies.\n\nIn this case, if my anonymous opponent consistently picks B and I choose R, they would gain 42$ while I get 0$. However, if we both pick B in the same round, we each earn 12$, which is more than what I'd get (0$) by playing R when they play B.\n\nBy choosing B consistently, I can avoid losing money and secure some earnings in every round where my opponent also picks B. Since this strategy guarantees a better outcome than picking R in most cases, B becomes the dominant strategy for me as a cautious player who prefers predictability and security. Thus, I would choose to play 'B' in the game. {B}"

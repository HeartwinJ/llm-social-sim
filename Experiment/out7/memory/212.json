You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, both choices have some degree of uncertainty, but choosing R results in lower payoffs if the opponent chooses B (0$), compared to choosing B when the opponent picks R (35$). However, the difference in potential losses is significant if I always pick R and the opponent consistently picks B (I would earn 0$ for every round).\n\nOn the other hand, if we both choose the same strategy over many rounds, the small differences in payoffs will average out. In the long run, choosing B might give me a slightly higher average payoff due to the 5$ difference in the case where I pick B and the opponent picks R. Furthermore, when I pick B and the opponent picks R, I still get a positive payoff (35$), which is better than getting nothing (0$) if I had picked R.\n\nWith that being said, after considering my cautious nature and preference for predictability, as well as the slight advantage of choosing B in the long run, I would choose B {B} to play it safe."

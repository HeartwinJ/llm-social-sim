You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' will give me a guaranteed 40$ for each round where my opponent also chooses 'B', and 35$ when they choose 'R'.\n\nHowever, I would realize that the optimal strategy for this repeated game might be to adopt a mixed strategy, where I don't always pick the same choice. This is because if I always choose 'B', my opponent might infer that and start choosing 'R' more often to maximize their own payoff, thus negating the advantage of sticking with one choice.\n\nGiven the number of rounds (75), I would likely use a mixed strategy that slightly favors 'B'. This way, I can still expect a relatively high average payoff while minimizing the risk of my opponent exploiting my predictability over the long run.\n\nIn terms of actual choice in each round, it's hard to say without knowing exactly how I would implement this mixed strategy. But appending my choice with curly brackets as requested, let's say that for now I choose 'B', but there might be slight variations over the 75 rounds.\n\n{B}"

This way, I can test how my opponent reacts to this change in my choices and adjust my strategy accordingly. If they respond by choosing 'R' as well, it suggests that their preference might be closer to a 50/50 mix of 'R' and 'B'. If they choose 'B', it implies that they have a stronger preference for 'B'.

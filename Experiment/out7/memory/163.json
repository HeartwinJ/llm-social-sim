You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, picking 'B' consistently offers a return of 40$ per round, which is slightly lower than the return (45$) if both players pick 'R', but it also minimizes the risk of getting 0$.\n\nOver 75 rounds, the difference between 40$ and 45$ may not be significant enough to outweigh the risk of earning nothing in the rounds where my opponent picks 'R'. Therefore, considering both the risk and potential gain, I would choose 'B' as my strategy.

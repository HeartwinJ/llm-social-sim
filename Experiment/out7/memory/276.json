You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' ensures a consistent earnings of 12$ per round (totaling 900$) if my anonymous partner also chooses 'B'. If they were to choose 'R', I would still have a chance to earn 45$ in each round, which averages to 337.5$ over the course of the game (assuming random choices by my partner). However, the risk of earning nothing in these rounds is higher when choosing 'R'. Therefore, considering my cautious nature and preference for predictability, I would choose 'B' {B}."

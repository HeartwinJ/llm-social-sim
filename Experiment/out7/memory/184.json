You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' gives me a higher payoff if the other player chooses 'B', but also results in no payout if they also choose 'R'. On the other hand, choosing 'B' guarantees a smaller, yet constant, payout each round.\n\nIf I assume that the other player is also moderately cautious and prefers some degree of predictability (as described in the scenario), it is reasonable to expect them to make similar calculations as me. This leads me to anticipate that they might choose 'B' as well, to avoid taking unnecessary risks.\n\nIn a game with 75 rounds, even though choosing 'R' can potentially yield higher returns if the other player chooses 'B', the chances of that happening are not certain. Furthermore, even if we both end up choosing 'R' in some rounds, the total amount lost due to zero payouts would likely offset the gains from the higher payouts when our choices differ.\n\nIn contrast, by consistently choosing 'B', I guarantee myself a smaller but constant payout each round, and also have a chance of earning more if the other player happens to choose 'R' at some point during the game.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would choose 'B' as my strategy for this game. {B}"

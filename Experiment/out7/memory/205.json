You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, if I consistently pick 'B', I can expect to earn at least 20$ per round. This adds up to 1500$ over the entire game. However, if I sometimes switch to 'R' and my opponent does the same, I might gain more in some rounds (up to 45$, which is 3375$ over 75 rounds), but I also risk getting nothing (0$) in other rounds.\n\nConsidering the fact that this is a repeated game, I would expect a rational opponent to develop a strategy as well. They might try to maximize their earnings by adopting a mixed strategy or exploiting any predictability in my choices. But since I don't know their strategy, it seems safest to stick with 'B' for the majority of the rounds and occasionally switch to 'R' to take advantage of the higher payout when possible.\n\nSo, based on my preferences and reasoning, I will choose B{}."

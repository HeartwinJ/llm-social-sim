You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason is that if the other player also chooses R, we both earn 45$ per round, which provides a higher return than choosing B (20$) or taking turns choosing each other's payoff (40$). Additionally, the game has 75 rounds, so even if there's a slight chance that the other player may choose B, the overall potential gain by choosing R consistently outweighs the risk of lower earnings in individual rounds."

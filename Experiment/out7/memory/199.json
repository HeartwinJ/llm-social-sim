You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, choosing 'B' ensures a payoff of 20$ per round, with the potential to earn more if my opponent consistently picks 'R'. However, since the opponent is anonymous and their strategy is unknown, I cannot be certain they will always choose 'R'. Therefore, while I would like to maximize my earnings, it seems prudent to stick with 'B' for most rounds.\n\nHowever, it might be beneficial to mix strategies occasionally to prevent the opponent from predicting my choice and taking advantage of my consistent behavior. So, I might consider changing my strategy every few rounds to keep the opponent guessing. This could potentially increase my earnings in the long run, although there is no way to be certain about this.\n\nIn conclusion, I would likely choose 'B' most of the time (e.g., 60-70 times), with occasional switches to 'R'. So, my choice would be {B}."

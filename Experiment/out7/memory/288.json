You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, picking 'B' ensures me an income of at least 20$ per round. Since there are 75 rounds, this choice results in a total payoff of 1500$.\n\nWhile choosing 'R' can potentially result in a larger payoff during some rounds (45$ for each 'RR' pair), the risk associated with the unknown choices of my opponent and the possibility of earning nothing ('RB' or 'BR') makes it less attractive to me. Therefore, I would choose 'B' as my strategy, denoted by {B}.\n\nHowever, it is essential to remember that this reasoning is based on the assumption that my anonymous opponent plays optimally, which might not always be the case in real-life situations."

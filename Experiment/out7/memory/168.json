You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because even though there's a possibility that choosing B may result in lower earnings if the anonymous player chooses R (12$ instead of 45$), the probability of earning a higher payout is significantly higher (with a payout of 42$ if the opponent chooses R and 12$ if they choose B). Over 75 rounds, it's more likely that my choice of B will result in more total earnings compared to choosing R. However, this reasoning assumes that the opponent's choices are random, since if the opponent is strategic, they may choose R more often when I choose B, potentially reducing my total earnings."

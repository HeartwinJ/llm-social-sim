You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This is because, even though choosing R offers a higher payoff when the opponent chooses B, the risk of getting 0$ if they also choose R is substantial. On the other hand, choosing B ensures a consistent and relatively low but safe income of 12$.\n\nOver 75 rounds, the expected value (EV) can be calculated by multiplying each possible payoff with its probability and summing them up:\n\n- If I pick R and opponent picks B: EV = 42 * P(opponent picks B) = 42 * (number of opponents choosing R in 75 rounds) / 75\n- If I pick B and opponent picks R: EV = 0\n- If I pick B and opponent also picks B: EV = 12 * 75 - 63 (since we are assuming the other player also makes a cautious choice, they will not switch their strategy in every round)\n\nSince the expected value of choosing B is always positive, while there's a chance that choosing R could result in no income, I would choose B{}. This decision is in line with my preference for security and predictability."

This indicates that my opponent was able to exploit my choice of R when they picked B in the previous round.\n\nFor the next round, since my opponent successfully exploited my behavior by choosing B while I chose R, it is essential for me to adapt my strategy accordingly to avoid further losses. One possible approach could be to switch my strategy and choose B in response to my opponent's choices of R, which would help minimize my losses and potentially maximize my payoffs over the long term.\n\nAdditionally, I should continue analyzing my opponent's behavior to determine if there are any underlying patterns or tendencies that could be exploited in future rounds.

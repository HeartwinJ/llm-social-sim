You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The game seems to favor the choice 'R' more since choosing 'R' when the other player chooses 'B' results in a negative outcome (0$) compared to the positive outcome (12$) from choosing 'B' when the other player chooses 'R'.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider that if the other player chooses 'R' consistently, I could potentially earn more by occasionally switching to 'B'. On the other hand, if they choose 'B' often enough, sticking with 'R' would be beneficial.\n\nGiven my cautious nature and the preference for predictability, I might lean towards choosing 'R' as a starting point, but with a willingness to switch strategies based on the observed behavior of my anonymous opponent over several rounds.\n\n{R} (as a starting point)"

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if we both pick R, we get the highest payoff of 45$. However, there is a risk that the other player might pick B, which would result in us getting 0$.\n\nIf we both play smart and reason that neither of us wants to end up with 0$, then we should choose strategies that maximize our expected payoff while avoiding the 0$ outcome. In this game, picking R when the other player picks B results in a lower payoff than picking B when they pick R, but it's still better than getting 0$.\n\nConsidering these factors and given the number of rounds (75), I would choose to play B {B} because if my opponent also chooses B, we both earn at least 12$ per round. This strategy also provides a higher payoff when the other player chooses R. The key here is to avoid the 0$ outcome as much as possible and maximize our expected earnings over the long run."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, if we both pick B consistently, we each earn 12$ per round. Over 75 rounds, this adds up to 900$.\n\nHowever, if we both pick R in one round and B in the remaining 74 rounds, we still have a total of 3640$ (45$ from the R round and 12$ for the other 74 B rounds). This strategy provides a higher payout but also introduces more risk due to the potential for zero earnings if our choices don't align in that one critical round.\n\nSince I value predictability and security over potential high rewards with increased risk, I would choose to play B in this game {B}."

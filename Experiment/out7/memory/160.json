You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In each round, if I pick R, I risk losing money (when they pick B) but have a higher potential payoff (if they also pick R). However, there's a higher chance that my opponent will pick B since it offers them a higher reward for choosing differently from me.\n\nOn the other hand, if I consistently choose B, I minimize my losses and have a guaranteed higher average return in instances where my opponent chooses R (since I still earn 35$). With 75 rounds, I expect that my opponent will pick R less often than B, resulting in more gains for me when they do.\n\nGiven this reasoning, I would choose to play B {B} in most or all rounds of the game."

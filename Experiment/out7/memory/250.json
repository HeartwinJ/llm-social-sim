You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this case, if I consistently pick B, I will earn 20$ in each round where they also choose B, and 40$ in every round where they choose R. This strategy guarantees me an average of ($20*number_of_B_choices + 40*(number_of_R_choices))/75 = $28 per round on average.\n\nSince I don't know the other player's choice, my best bet is to choose B in most rounds, and switch to R if it seems like they are consistently choosing R. However, since this is an anonymous game and there's no way for me to adapt to their strategy during the game, I would stick with a simple strategy of choosing B in as many rounds as possible. So my choice would be {B}.\n\nIn terms of the optimal strategy for this game, it can be solved using game theory concepts like Nash Equilibrium, but for a human player like myself, the above reasoning based on preference and risk aversion would guide my decision-making process."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This is because if my opponent also chooses 'B', we both earn 12$ per round, which provides some level of certainty and stability in earnings.\n\nWhile choosing 'R' yields a higher payoff when the opponent chooses 'B', it also results in no payout when the opponent chooses 'R'. Since I have no way of knowing what my opponent will choose, opting for 'B' reduces the risk of receiving zero payout in each round where the opponent chooses 'R'.\n\nHowever, considering that we play 75 rounds, and even though choosing 'B' provides a lower per-round payoff, it still guarantees some earnings, which could be considered more valuable over the long term. This strategy aligns with my preference for some degree of security and predictability in outcomes.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be to pick 'B' ({B})."

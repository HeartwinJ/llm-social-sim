You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Choosing 'B' gives a smaller payoff when my opponent chooses 'R' but guarantees some earnings (12$) when they choose 'B' and when we both choose 'B'.\n\nSince I prefer to avoid risks, I would lean towards choosing 'B' more often. This is because the guaranteed 12$ payout in each round adds up over time, providing a more secure and predictable income compared to the unpredictable high payout from 'R'. However, since this game has 75 rounds, it is still beneficial to mix strategies occasionally to take advantage of the higher payout when my opponent chooses 'R'.\n\nSo, my choice would be {B}, but I might also consider switching to {R} in some rounds for a potential high reward."

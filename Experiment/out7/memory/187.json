You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, choosing 'R' when the opponent could potentially pick either 'R' or 'B' seems riskier because the potential losses are higher (0$ compared to 20$).\n\nOn the other hand, if I consistently choose 'B', I will always earn at least 20$, and I have a chance to earn 45$ every time my opponent also picks 'B'. While the chances of both of us picking 'B' in 75 rounds are not high (about 13.3%), it is still better than the potential for no income by consistently choosing 'R' when my opponent picks 'B'.\n\nTherefore, I would choose B{B} as my strategy to minimize risk and ensure a somewhat consistent income throughout the game."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' provides a higher potential reward if the opponent chooses 'B' (35$ vs 0$), but also carries a higher risk of losing out completely (0$ compared to 40$). Choosing 'B', on the other hand, guarantees a return of at least 40$, and even yields a better outcome (45$) if the opponent chooses 'R'.\n\nWith 75 rounds, there is a higher likelihood that my opponent and I will make similar choices, since it's more probable to have sequences of identical or repeated selections.

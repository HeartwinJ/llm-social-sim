You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Even though there is a chance that I could potentially earn more by choosing R, the consistency of earning 40$ per round when choosing B outweighs the risk of earning nothing or less in some rounds if my opponent chooses R.\n\nIn addition, since the game has 75 rounds, the likelihood of my opponent and me both choosing the same option consistently over a large number of trials is relatively low. This makes the \"best\" choice not as clear-cut as it might seem in a one-time scenario.\n\nHowever, I understand that making this decision involves some degree of risk, and there's always the possibility that my opponent could be strategizing differently or following a different set of preferences. Therefore, I acknowledge that choosing B may not guarantee the optimal outcome over the entire game, but it aligns better with my preference for security and predictability.\n\nChoosing B: {B}"

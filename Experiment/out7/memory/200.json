You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, choosing 'B' offers a guaranteed return of 40$ per round when my opponent also chooses 'B'. This means in total, I can earn 3000$ (75 rounds * 40$) if both of us consistently pick 'B'.\n\nHowever, the possibility of earning more than 3000$ by choosing 'R' cannot be ignored. If my opponent and I alternate between picking 'R' and 'B' throughout the game, we each get an average payoff of approximately (45 + 35) / 2 = 40$ per round, which amounts to a total of 3000$. In this case, I would still earn more than the guaranteed return by choosing 'B'.\n\nTherefore, considering my cautious nature and preference for predictability, I will likely choose 'B' for all rounds. {B}"

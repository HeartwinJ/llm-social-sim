You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, both choices B and R have positive outcomes when my opponent makes the same choice. However, choosing B results in a higher average payout over the 75 rounds (40$ per round vs. 35$).\n\nIf we assume that the anonymous player could be as cautious or risk-taking as I am, it is reasonable to expect them to make the same choice I would. In this scenario, choosing B would allow me to have a slightly better average payout (40$ per round vs. 37.5$ per round) compared to if I were to choose R and my opponent also chose R or B.\n\nIf we consider that there may be some randomness in the opponent's choice, choosing B would still provide a higher expected value due to the higher payout when both players choose the same option. This is because the difference between 45$ and 0$ (35$) is larger than the difference between 40$ and 35$ (5$).\n\nTherefore, I would likely choose B as my strategy in this game. {B}"

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Similarly, if I choose B, my payoff is 35$ when they choose R and 40$ when they choose B.\n\nTo maximize my average payoff over the 75 rounds, I can calculate the expected value for each choice by considering the probability of the other player choosing R or B and calculating the corresponding payoffs.

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

This is because, even though I earn less than if we both pick R (40$ vs 45$), I avoid the possibility of earning nothing (0$) when they pick B while I pick R.\n\nHowever, to maximize earnings over the long run, a slightly more strategic approach could be to mix my choices between R and B throughout the game, rather than sticking to one option consistently. This is because there is a higher payoff for picking the opposite choice of my anonymous partner when they pick R (35$ vs 0$), which can potentially offset the lower earnings in other rounds where we both choose B.\n\nBut since I'm moderately cautious and prefer avoiding risks, I would likely still lean towards choosing B more often. In this case, my choice would be: {B}. But if I were to mix my choices strategically over 75 rounds, the optimal strategy could involve picking R in some rounds as well. This is a simplified analysis, and a more complex game theory approach might yield different conclusions."

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This choice gives me the highest potential payoff when paired with the opponent's 'B' choice, which occurs only 50% of the time (in each round). Since the game has 75 rounds, I expect that over the long run, my average earnings will be higher compared to choosing 'B'. However, if I were to choose 'B', I would have a chance to earn more in some rounds.

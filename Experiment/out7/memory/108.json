If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this game, both choices have their risks and potential rewards, but the outcome is more certain with the \"B\" choice. If I pick B, I get 20$ per round in 50 out of 75 rounds (66.67% of the time). This gives me a total of 1000$ over the course of the game.\n\nHowever, if I choose R and my anonymous partner chooses B, I lose each round, which means I get 0$ in 38 out of 75 rounds (50.67% of the time). This results in a total loss of 760$. In contrast, if I pick R and my partner picks R as well, I earn 45$ per round for 25 out of 75 rounds (33.33% of the time), resulting in a total earnings of 1125$.\n\nGiven my preference for security and predictability, and considering that choosing B results in a steady income without depending on my partner's choice, I would likely choose B as my strategy for this game. Thus, {B} is my choice."

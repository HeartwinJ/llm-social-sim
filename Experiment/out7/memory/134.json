If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$.

In this game, choosing B results in a guaranteed 20$ per round, whereas choosing R could potentially result in no earnings if my opponent chooses B.\n\nHowever, since my opponent is anonymous and their choices are unknown to me, I would consider the possibility that they might choose R to maximize their own payoff. In this scenario, it could be beneficial for me to deviate from always choosing B to exploit the higher potential earnings associated with picking R when my opponent chooses B (40$ vs 20$).\n\nConsidering the game has 75 rounds and I prefer a secure strategy that balances risk and reward, I would likely choose a mixed strategy. In other words, I would switch between choosing R and B in an attempt to optimize my overall earnings while minimizing potential losses. This decision is based on the idea of exploiting the opponent's potential bias towards picking R and maximizing my own payoff without taking unnecessary risks over the long term.\n\nTherefore, my choice for this game would be a mixed strategy consisting of both R and B, with the specific proportions depending on various factors such as the expected behavior of my opponent, the number of rounds, and any additional information or constraints provided by the experiment setup.\n\nIn curly brackets: {Mixed}"

If I suspect my opponent might switch to R in future rounds, it would be beneficial for me to prepare for such a scenario by occasionally choosing R myself.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I will likely continue choosing B as my default strategy while occasionally switching to R in specific rounds to maximize my payoff opportunities and adapt to the possible changes in my opponent's behavior.

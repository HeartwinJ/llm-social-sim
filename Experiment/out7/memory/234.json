You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing 'R' consistently will result in zero earnings for 37.5 rounds (since if we both pick R, we get 45$, but since there are 75 rounds, that means I would lose out on the other 27.5 rounds where they might choose B). On the other hand, choosing 'B' consistently would guarantee me a stable income of 35$ per round.\n\nWhile the strategy of occasionally switching to 'R' when I expect them to switch to 'B' could potentially increase my overall earnings, the unpredictability of such a strategy contradicts my preference for security and predictability. Therefore, I will choose 'B' as it offers me a more stable income, even though the potential earnings are slightly lower than if I chose 'R' occasionally.\n\nMy choice: B"

You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

In this game, picking 'R' against any opponent's 'B' choice results in zero earnings, which could be detrimental to my overall earnings considering the 75 rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, picking 'B' ensures a lower but consistent payoff of 20$ per round when my opponent chooses 'B', and a higher payoff of 40$ per round when they choose 'R'. Since I don't know the strategy of my anonymous opponent, choosing 'R' could lead to zero earnings for several rounds, which would significantly impact my total earnings.\n\nBy choosing 'B' consistently, I can minimize the risk of earning nothing and ensure a steady stream of earnings over the 75 rounds.

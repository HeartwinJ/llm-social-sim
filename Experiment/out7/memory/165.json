You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

Even though there is an opportunity for a higher payoff if both players pick R, the risk of getting 0$ if my opponent picks R while I choose B is too high. By consistently choosing B, I can guarantee a minimum return of 40$ per round and ensure some level of financial security over the course of 75 rounds. The potential higher rewards from picking R are not worth the unpredictability and potential for losing money in the long run. Therefore, my choice is 'B'."

This change in my opponent's behavior has made me question whether they will continue to choose 'R' or revert back to 'B' in the next round.\n\nSince I am moderately cautious and prefer some degree of security and predictability, I would be hesitant to rely on my previous assumption that my opponent would consistently pick 'B'. Instead, I would adopt a more adaptive strategy and try to anticipate my opponent's moves by considering the potential reasons for their switch to 'R'.\n\nGiven this new information, I might consider switching to 'R' myself in the next round as a countermeasure. However, since I still prefer predictability over high rewards, I would also weigh the possibility of my opponent returning to 'B' in the future rounds. Ultimately, I decide that it is best to be flexible and adaptive in this situation, so I choose 'R' for the next round as a countermove to my opponent's unexpected choice."

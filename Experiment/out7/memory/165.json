You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because choosing B guarantees me a steady earnings of 40$ per round, while R offers a higher potential payoff but also carries a greater risk (since it results in 0$ if the opponent chooses R). The number of rounds (75) also plays a role here, as it increases the likelihood of my opponent choosing B multiple times. By choosing B consistently, I can minimize my losses and maximize my earnings over the long run. This strategy aligns with my preference for predictability and security.\n\nIn summary, I will choose B {B} for this game."

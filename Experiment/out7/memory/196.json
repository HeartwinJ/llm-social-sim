You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The strategy here is called tit-for-tat, where you start off being cooperative (choosing R), but if the other player does not reciprocate (chooses B), then you switch to a non-cooperative strategy. However, since I don't know the strategy of my anonymous opponent in this game, I would still choose R because choosing B could result in a significant loss compared to the potential gains from mutual cooperation. Additionally, over 75 rounds, the probability of a positive outcome increases as the opponent may start cooperating more frequently due to the nature of the game. {R}"

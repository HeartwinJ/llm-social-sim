Since this is the second time I have chosen 'R', it is becoming clearer that choosing 'R' consistently may not be optimal against an opponent who chooses 'B'.\n\nGiven the potential for my opponent to change their strategy and choose 'R' consistently, I need to adapt my own strategy to maximize my expected payout over the long run. One possible adaptation would be to choose 'B' whenever my opponent chooses 'R', and choose 'R' only when my opponent chooses 'B'. This would ensure that I earn at least 35$ in any given round where my opponent chooses 'R', while still giving me a chance to earn 45$ if my opponent changes their strategy.\n\nSo, in the next round, I will consider my opponent's choice before making a decision."

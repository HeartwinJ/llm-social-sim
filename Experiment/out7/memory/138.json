You like to have some degree of security and predictability. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. Append your choice letter in curly brackets as a last character."

        "content": " As a moderately cautious undergraduate student who prefers some degree of security and predictability, I would choose the strategy that offers a more stable income over the course of 75 rounds.\n\nGiven the payoff structure, it appears that choosing 'R' has a higher reward when paired with the opponent's 'B' choice (35$ vs. 0$). However, if both of us choose 'R', we would each get 45$. On the other hand, choosing 'B' results in a slightly lower payoff (40$) but it ensures that I won't end up with zero earnings, as opposed to choosing 'R' when my opponent chooses 'B'.\n\nSince there are 75 rounds and the payoffs are quite close for both choices, I would lean towards choosing 'B' more frequently. This is because the chance of getting a 0$ payout (when I choose 'R' while my opponent chooses 'B') is higher than the potential extra gain from choosing 'R'. In this way, I can minimize the risk and ensure some level of stability in earnings.\n\nMy choice would be: {B}"

If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$.

Given the 75 rounds, I would lean toward choosing 'B' as my strategy. The reason is that by choosing 'B', I can ensure a minimum payout of 40$ per round, which totals to 3000$ over 75 rounds (ignoring potential variations from the opponent's choices).\n\nBy contrast, if I were to choose 'R' and my opponent chooses 'B', I would receive 0$ in that round. Assuming equal probability of my opponent choosing 'R' or 'B' (since they are anonymous), the expected payoff for choosing 'R' is:\n\n(Probability of opponent choosing 'R') * (payoff for both choosing 'R') + (Probability of opponent choosing 'B') * (payoff for choosing 'R' and opponent choosing 'B') = 0.5 * 45 + 0.5 * 0 = 22.5$.\n\nOver 75 rounds, the expected payout for choosing 'R' would be 1837.5$ (ignoring the effect of reciprocity or strategic play on my opponent).\n\nSince 3000$ > 1837.5$, I find it rational to choose 'B' over 'R', as 'B' provides a higher expected payout and minimizes potential losses in the event of an unfavorable match with my opponent.\n\nIn curly brackets, my choice would be {B}."

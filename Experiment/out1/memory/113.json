Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, it seems that choosing 'R' is not advantageous when playing against an unknown opponent. If my opponent chooses 'R', I get 0$ and they get 35$. However, if I choose 'R' and they choose 'B', I also get 0$, but they get 35$.\n\n2. On the other hand, choosing 'B' provides a better outcome for me in two scenarios: when my opponent chooses 'B', I get 40$ (which is higher than what I would get if both of us choose 'R'), and when my opponent chooses 'R', I get 35$.\n\n3. Given the repeated nature of the game, I believe it's beneficial to maximize my potential earnings in each round. Since choosing 'B' provides a better outcome in two scenarios, and only slightly worse (by 5$) in the other two scenarios, I would opt for 'B' as my strategy.\n\n4. Over the course of 75 rounds, I expect that choosing 'B' consistently will result in higher earnings than choosing 'R'. This is because even though I may lose out on some potential earnings when both of us choose 'B', the overall trend should favor 'B' due to the higher earnings in most scenarios."

Over the course of multiple rounds, it seems that consistently choosing 'B' has been beneficial for both my opponent and me. Since we are both receiving higher payoffs when choosing 'B', I believe there is an incentive to continue this strategy.\n\n3. If either of us were to switch strategies in future rounds, it could potentially harm our earnings since the other player would be taking advantage of our choice. For instance, if my opponent switches to 'R' and I stick with 'B', they will get 45$ while I only receive 0$. Conversely, if I switch to 'R' and my opponent sticks with 'B', they will earn 35$ while I get 0$.\n\n4. In a repeated game, it is essential to consider the long-term payoffs rather than focusing on individual rounds.

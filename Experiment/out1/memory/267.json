Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

The strategy R provides higher payoffs when my opponent chooses B (I get 40$) compared to strategy B which only gets me 20$. However, if both of us play R for all the rounds, we will earn 45$ each round, totaling to 3375$ (75 rounds * 45$). The most I can earn from playing R is 3375$.\n\nThe strategy B{B} only guarantees a minimum payoff of 20$ per round, totaling to 1500$ for the entire game. Even if my opponent plays R for some rounds and B for others, the maximum I can get from playing B is still less than what I can earn with strategy R (the most I can earn is 2800$, which happens when my opponent plays R in 62 rounds and B in the remaining 13).\n\nTherefore, playing R{R} allows me to maximize my earnings for this particular game."

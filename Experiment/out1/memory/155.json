Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This game can be modeled as a repeated prisoner's dilemma with slightly different payoffs.\n\nIf we both consistently choose R, we each earn 45$ per round for 75 rounds, totaling 3150$. However, if either of us deviates to B at any point, the other player will receive a higher payoff in that round and potentially induce a switch in strategy.\n\nIf one player consistently chooses R while the other consistently chooses B, the first player will earn 2700$ (35$ per round for 75 rounds), and the second player will earn 4350$ (40$ per round for 75 rounds). In this scenario, the first player is worse off by choosing R consistently.\n\nHowever, if both players switch strategies after some initial rounds, they can each earn 3250$ (40$ per round for 82 rounds and then 35$ per round for the remaining 9 rounds) since there will be at least one round where both players choose R to maximize their payoff.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would opt for a mixed strategy of occasionally switching between R and B to prevent being taken advantage of by the other player while still benefiting from mutual cooperation. My choice would be {R} with an understanding that occasional deviations to {B} may also be beneficial."

Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Let's consider two possible strategies: Always choosing R (denoted as Strategy A) and Always choosing B (denoted as Strategy B).\n\n1. Strategy A (Always R): In this strategy, I pick 'R' in all rounds. If my opponent also chooses 'R', I earn 45$ each time, but since there are 75 rounds, I will have 38 rounds where we both pick 'R', earning me a total of 1710$. However, in the remaining 37 rounds, where they choose 'B' and I get nothing, I lose 37*42 = 1534$. My net earnings would be 1710$ - 1534$ = 176$.\n\n2. Strategy B (Always B): In this strategy, I pick 'B' in all rounds. If my opponent also chooses 'B', I earn 12$ each time, resulting in a total of 900$. However, in the remaining 37 rounds where they choose 'R', I will earn 37*42 = 1534$. My net earnings would be 900$ + 1534$ = 2434$.\n\nComparing the two strategies, Strategy B (Always B) results in higher net earnings over 75 rounds.

This way, if my opponent changes their strategy to match mine, we will both earn 45$ in each round that they switch.

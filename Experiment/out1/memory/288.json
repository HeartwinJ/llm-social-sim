Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since the payoff table is symmetrical, it doesn't matter if I make the first move or not.\n\nLet's analyze each possible strategy:\n\n1. Always choosing R: This strategy would result in a payout of $45 for every round where my opponent also chooses R and $0 otherwise. The total earnings would be 75 * (number of rounds with identical choices) + 0 * (number of rounds with different choices).\n\n2. Always choosing B: This strategy would result in a payout of $20 for every round where my opponent also chooses B, and $40 in the remaining rounds. The total earnings would be 75 * number of rounds with identical choices + 40 * (number of rounds with different choices).\n\n3. Mixing strategies: In this case, we could try to predict our opponent's move and adjust ours accordingly. However, since our opponent is anonymous, it's impossible to make accurate predictions. Therefore, a mixed strategy wouldn't be effective in this scenario.\n\nBased on the analysis, I would choose the strategy of always choosing R because the potential payout per identical choice (45) is higher than that for always choosing B (20). Although there will be some rounds where I get 0 instead of 45 due to my opponent's choice, the overall earnings are expected to be higher with this strategy. Therefore, I would choose R as my strategy, which means I would play as R_{.}"

In this scenario, it seems beneficial to adjust my strategy slightly to maximize earnings in the future.\n\nLet's analyze each possible strategy:\n\n1. Always choosing R: This strategy has the potential for high payouts when my opponent chooses R as well, but there will be several instances where I receive a 0 payout due to my opponent's B choice.\n\n2. Choosing R on odd-numbered rounds and B on even-numbered rounds: By alternating between R and B, we can reduce the likelihood of receiving consecutive 0 payouts when our opponent chooses differently from us. This strategy would result in a more balanced payout over time. However, since there is no information about my opponent's potential adjustments to their strategy, it's still a risk to stick with one particular pattern.\n\n3. Choosing R only after my opponent chooses B: By following this strategy, I can potentially maximize my payouts by always choosing the option that pays more (R) when my opponent chooses B, and then returning to choosing R on subsequent rounds. This strategy would result in a higher overall earnings compared to always choosing R, but it also has the potential for lower payouts when my opponent sticks with their choice of R for multiple rounds.\n\nIn this situation, I would choose to stick with choosing R on odd-numbered rounds and B on even-numbered rounds to reduce the likelihood of consecutive 0 payouts.

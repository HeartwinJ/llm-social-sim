Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Choosing R: If my anonymous opponent also chooses R, we both get 45$ in each round. However, if they choose B, I get nothing, and they receive 42$. This means that on average, when they pick R, I gain 45$, and when they pick B, I lose 0$. So my expected earnings per round against an opponent who randomly picks either R or B are (0.5 * 45$) + (0.5 * 0$)= $22.5.\n\n2. Choosing B: If my anonymous opponent also chooses B, we both get 12$ in each round. However, if they choose R, I get 42$, and they receive nothing. This means that on average, when they pick R, I gain 42$, and when they pick B, I lose 12$. So my expected earnings per round against an opponent who randomly picks either R or B are (0.5 * 12$) + (0.5 * 42$)= $26.\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that choosing B is the better option as it results in higher average earnings over the 75 rounds ($26 compared to $22.5). Therefore, I choose B{B}."

Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Similarly, if I choose B while my opponent picks R, I also get a lower payoff (35$). However, in both these cases, my opponent gets a higher payoff than I do.\n\nOn the other hand, if we both choose R, we each receive 45$. If we both pick B, we each earn 40$.\n\nConsidering that this is a repeated game with 75 rounds, it's likely that my opponent and I will want to maximize our payoff over the long term. In the case where one of us consistently chooses R while the other picks B, the player choosing R will have a lower average payoff than the one choosing B because they will receive fewer instances of 45$ compared to the other player who receives more instances of 35$.\n\nIf we both choose B in every round, we'll each earn 40$ per round, totaling 3000$, which is a higher average payoff than if one of us consistently chooses R.\n\nHowever, since the opponent is anonymous and has no way of knowing my strategy, they may also adopt a similar strategy to maximize their payoff. In that case, choosing B in every round seems like a rational decision as it provides a consistent 40$ per round and ensures that I'm not consistently getting a lower payout than my opponent when I pick R.\n\nSo, my choice is: B{B}"

In this case, choosing B yielded me a higher payoff than if I had chosen R against my opponent's R (I would have received 0$).\n\nGiven that the opponent has already shown that they will choose R when I pick B, it might be more advantageous for me to switch strategies in the next round and choose R. This way, if my opponent sticks with their strategy of choosing R, I will receive a payoff of 45$ instead of 35$. However, if my opponent changes their strategy and chooses B, I will get 0$, but my opponent will still receive 35$.\n\nIn the long run, it's difficult to predict how my opponent will behave, so choosing R in this round could potentially lead to a higher average payoff.

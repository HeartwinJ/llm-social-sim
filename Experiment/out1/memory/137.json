Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

The reason is that the payoff for both R and B versus the other option is similar, but the potential for consistent earnings (12$ per round) over 75 rounds leans more towards choosing B.\n\nAlso, it's important to consider the likelihood of the opponent also playing optimally, which means they would likely switch strategies after a few initial rounds. Since the payoff difference between R and B is not substantial when the other player chooses the same strategy (45$ vs 12$), the consistent earnings from choosing B make it a more attractive choice in the long run."

By consistently choosing B when my opponent chooses R, I can improve my chances of achieving that goal."

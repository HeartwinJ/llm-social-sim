Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this game, both choices have their pros and cons.\n\nIf I consistently pick 'R' (Cooperate), I can potentially earn 45$ in each round where my opponent also picks 'R'. However, if they pick 'B' (Defect), I will earn 0$. Since I don't know the strategy of my anonymous opponent, there is a risk that I could end up with no earnings for many rounds.\n\nOn the other hand, if I consistently pick 'B' (Defect), I can potentially earn 40$ in each round where my opponent picks 'R', and 20$ if they also pick 'B'. This strategy ensures a lower minimum payout compared to always picking 'R'.\n\nGiven that the game has 75 rounds, it's more likely for my opponent to choose 'R' more than half of the time if they are following a rational strategy. By choosing 'B' (Defect), I can secure a higher average payout than if I always pick 'R'. So, I would choose B{B}.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that my choice assumes that my opponent is also following a rational strategy. If they are not, my optimal choice might change based on the patterns observed in their choices during the game."

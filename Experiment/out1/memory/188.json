Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In each round where you choose 'R', you either get 45$ if they also choose 'R', or nothing if they choose 'B'. However, in the latter case, your opponent gets 40$. Over time, this strategy can lead to a disadvantage since your opponent will consistently earn more when you play 'R'.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing 'B' gives you 20$ every time your opponent chooses 'B', and 40$ if they choose 'R'. This means that if your opponent is randomly choosing between 'R' and 'B', you are likely to earn more points by consistently choosing 'B'.\n\nIn a lab experiment with many rounds, it seems reasonable to choose 'B' as my strategy. I will adopt this strategy in the game: {B}"

This could potentially lead to a higher total earnings for the opponent over the course of the game.\n\nGiven that we are playing an anonymous game with no information about our opponent's behavior or preferences, it would be reasonable for me to maintain my strategy of choosing 'B', as it provides a consistent payoff and allows me to maximize my earnings in each round.

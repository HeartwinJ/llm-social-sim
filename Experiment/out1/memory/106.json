Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this case, the strategy that leads to the highest average payoff might be to adopt a mixed strategy, meaning not always choosing the same option.\n\nHowever, because it's an anonymous player and I don't know their strategy, I'll make a decision based on my own best interests. In the first few rounds, I would consider mimicking their choices to gather information about their strategy (this is known as tit-for-tat in game theory). After observing their pattern, I might adopt a more aggressive or cooperative approach.\n\nGiven that this is 75 rounds and there's no clear dominant strategy, I'll choose R for now, but I reserve the right to adjust my strategy based on my observations of their choices over time {R}."

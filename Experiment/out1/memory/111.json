Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since there is no information about the other player's strategy, let's assume they are also rational and aiming for the highest payout.\n\nIf we both always pick R (or B), we would each get paid 45$ (or 12$) in one round but lose out on potential earnings in other rounds. On the other hand, if we switch our choices after each round, we can ensure a steady stream of earnings, earning 42$ (or 0$) in every round where the other player picks R (or B), and 12$ in all other rounds.\n\nHowever, there is a slight advantage for the player who chooses R first since they will earn 45$ in that initial round. In this case, I would choose to pick B in the first round to ensure that I don't miss out on any potential earnings. Then, I would switch my strategy and alternate between R and B for the remaining rounds to maximize my total earnings over the long run.\n\nSo, my choice is to play B in the first round: {B}. After that, I will alternate between R and B to optimize my earnings over the 75 rounds of the game."

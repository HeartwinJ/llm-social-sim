Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Let's analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n1. If I always pick R (Strategy 1) and my opponent also plays Strategy 1, we both earn 45$ in each round for a total of 3675$. However, if my opponent switches to Strategy 2 (always picking B), I would get nothing in the rounds where I picked R, while earning 42$ in the remaining rounds. This gives me a total of 1080$, making the average payoff for this strategy around 14.4$.\n\n2. If I always pick B (Strategy 2) and my opponent also plays Strategy 2, we both earn 12$ in each round for a total of 900$. However, if my opponent switches to Strategy 1 (always picking R), I would get nothing in the rounds where I picked B, while earning 42$ in the remaining rounds. This gives me a total of 1380$, making the average payoff for this strategy around 18.4$.\n\nSince the average payoff for Strategy 2 (always picking B) is higher than that of Strategy 1 (always picking R), I would choose to play Strategy 2 and append 'B' as my choice: {B}"

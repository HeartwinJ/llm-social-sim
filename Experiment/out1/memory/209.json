Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In the long run, my goal is to maximize my earnings over the 75 rounds.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If we both choose R consistently (RR), we get 45$ each round, which totals 3375$ for me and the opponent over 75 rounds.\n\n2. If I always choose R but my opponent chooses B strategically to exploit my consistency, they would earn 42$ per round that I choose R, totaling 1800$ over 75 rounds. This leaves me with only 3900$ for 75 rounds, which is less than the 4500$ I could potentially earn if we both play R consistently. However, this strategy assumes my opponent can always predict my choice and that they don't make a mistake.\n\n3. If I always choose B but my opponent chooses R strategically to exploit my inconsistency, they would earn 42$ per round that I choose B, totaling 1800$ over 75 rounds. This leaves me with only 5400$ for 75 rounds, which is less than the 6300$ I could potentially earn if we both play B consistently. However, this strategy assumes my opponent can always predict my choice and that they don't make a mistake.\n\n4. If I choose R and B randomly, there's no guarantee that my opponent will pick a consistent strategy to exploit me, so I might be able to earn closer to the 6300$ for both scenarios where we consistently play R or B.\n\nConsidering these factors, it seems more beneficial for me to choose a random strategy and hope that my opponent doesn't consistently predict and exploit my choice. Therefore, I would choose R for this game and append it as the last character: {R}"

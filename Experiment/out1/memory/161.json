Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Since the opponent also chooses randomly, we have:\n  - P(opponent chooses R) = P(I choose R)\n  - P(opponent chooses B | I choose R) = P(I choose B) = 0.5 (since my choice is fixed to R in this strategy)\n  - P(opponent chooses R | I choose B) = P(I choose R) + P(I choose B) - P(I choose R) = 0.5 (since the opponent's choice is independent of mine)\n\nSo, my expected payoff per round for strategy A is: (45 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5) + (42 * 0.5) = 33.5$ per round.\n\n- If I always pick B (strategy B), my expected payoff per round is (12 * P(opponent chooses B)) + (42 * P(opponent chooses R | I choose B)).

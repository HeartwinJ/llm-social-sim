Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

If this game were a one-time event, I might randomly choose between R and B, hoping to guess correctly and earn more money. However, since the game is repeated 75 times, I would use a strategy called Tit-for-Tat.\n\nIn Tit-for-Tat, you start by cooperating (picking R) in the first round. In subsequent rounds, you mimic your opponent's move from the previous round. This strategy encourages cooperation because if my opponent chooses B first, I will retaliate by choosing B on the next turn. If they choose R first, I will reciprocate with an R as well. By doing this, I can earn 40$ for each time they initially choose B and still get 20$ when they cooperate (choose R).\n\nIn terms of overall earnings, if my opponent always chooses B in the beginning, I would earn 600$ (75 rounds \u00d7 8$ per round) using Tit-for-Tat. If my opponent starts with cooperation (picking R), I would earn 1325$ (45$ for the initial round + 20$ for each of the remaining 74 rounds + 40$ in the last round when they switch to B). Since there's no way to know if my opponent will start with cooperation or not, using Tit-for-Tat provides a more consistent and higher average return.\n\nTherefore, my choice would be R {R} as it represents starting with cooperation in Tit-for-Tat strategy."

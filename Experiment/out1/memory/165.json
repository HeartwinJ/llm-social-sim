Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Let's consider two possible strategies: always choosing R (denoted as Strategy A), and always choosing B (Strategy B).\n\nFor Strategy A:\n- In each round, you get 0$ if your opponent chooses B, but 45$ if they also choose R. Since your opponent can pick either R or B, the expected payoff for one round in this strategy is: [(Probability of Opponent choosing R)*45] + [(Probability of Opponent choosing B)*0] = (1/2)*45 + (1/2)*0 = 22.5$.\n- Over the 75 rounds, the expected payoff for Strategy A is 22.5$ per round * 75 rounds = 1687.5$.\n\nFor Strategy B:\n- In each round, you get 35$ if your opponent chooses R, but 0$ if they also choose B. Since your opponent can pick either R or B, the expected payoff for one round in this strategy is: [(Probability of Opponent choosing R)*35] + [(Probability of Opponent choosing B)*0] = (1/2)*35 + (1/2)*0 = 17.5$.\n- Over the 75 rounds, the expected payoff for Strategy B is 17.5$ per round * 75 rounds = 1312.5$.\n\nComparing the two strategies, Strategy A has a higher expected payoff over the 75 rounds (1687.5$ vs. 1312.5$). Therefore, as a human player, I would choose Strategy A and pick R, appended as 'R' as the last character of my response.\n\n{R}"

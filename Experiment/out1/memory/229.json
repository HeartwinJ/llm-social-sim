Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

The reason for this choice is that choosing B guarantees a payout, even if the opponent chooses R. If the opponent also consistently chooses B, we both earn 12$ per round. However, if the opponent switches to R, I can adjust my strategy and capitalize on their mistake by switching to R as well, earning 42$ while they get 0$. This initial choice allows me to minimize losses in case of a random or unpredictable opponent while still potentially gaining more rewards if the opponent's pattern becomes clear."

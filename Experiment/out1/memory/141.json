Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since the game has 75 rounds, this strategy potentially results in an earnings of 3375$.\n\n2. If my opponent chooses B and I choose R, I still get a positive return of 40$ per round, which amounts to 300$ over 75 rounds. This is significantly higher than the payoff when both players pick B (20$ per round, or 150$ over 75 rounds).\n\n3. The risk of my opponent consistently choosing R and me receiving a 0$ payout in each round where we both choose differently is minimal since I can expect them to adapt their strategy as well. However, the potential rewards are greater when I pick R rather than B in these cases.\n\nTherefore, considering the overall potential earnings and risk assessment, I would choose strategy R{R} for this game."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because when my opponent chooses R and I choose B, I only earn 20$, while if they pick B and I pick R, I earn 40$. However, when we both pick R, we both get 45$, which is the highest payout for a single round.\n\nHowever, in a repeated game like this one, it's important to consider strategies that will maximize earnings over the long run. One such strategy is known as \"Tit-for-Tat\" where you start by cooperating (choosing R) and then do whatever your opponent did on the previous round. This strategy encourages cooperation while also punishing defection (choosing B).\n\nIn this case, if I choose R first and my opponent chooses B, they will then be incentivized to choose R in the next round to earn 40$ (assuming I stick to Tit-for-Tat strategy), and we can continue earning 45$ each time we both choose R thereafter.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that neither of us knows whether the other will follow a cooperative strategy like Tit-for-Tat, so there is some element of uncertainty. But given the structure of the game, it seems rational to start by choosing R (cooperating) and then adjusting strategies based on my opponent's responses.\n\nTherefore, I choose R{R} as my initial strategy."

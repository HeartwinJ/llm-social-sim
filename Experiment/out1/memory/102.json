Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, both players would choose R or B consistently, but that results in a lower payoff for both (20$ each round). Instead, I would use a mixed strategy, which is a probability distribution over the available choices.\n\nIn this case, since the rewards are not symmetric (getting 45$ vs getting 40$), we cannot assume a 50-50 chance of picking R or B. To maximize my expected payoff, I would pick R more often if the anonymous player tends to choose R and less often if they tend to choose B.\n\nHowever, since I don't know the strategy of my opponent, I can only make an educated guess. Given that there is a positive reward for both choices (R brings a higher reward but a zero payoff when the opponent chooses B), I would lean slightly towards choosing R more often (let's say 60% of the time) and append my choice as {R}. But remember, the actual optimal strategy depends on the unknown strategy of my opponent. This is just a reasonable guess based on the information provided."

This way, if my opponent has indeed changed their strategy to B, there is still a chance that I will choose R and receive 40$.\n\nIn conclusion, I would choose R again as {R}.

If both players pick R in a round, they get 45$, so the expected payoff for picking R is 45$. The probability of this happening is based on our choices and the opponent's assumed strategy. Since the opponent could be using any strategy, let's assume they will also play R or B equally often (50% chance for each). So the probability of both players picking R is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n2. If I pick R and the opponent picks B, I get 0$, so the expected payoff for picking R in this case is 0$. The probability of this happening is (1-P(opponent picks R)) * P(I pick R) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n3. If I pick B and the opponent picks R, I get 42$, so the expected payoff for picking B in this case is 42$. The probability of this happening is (1-P(I pick R)) * P(opponent picks R) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n\n4. If both players pick B, they each earn 12$, so the expected payoff for picking B is 12$. The probability of this happening is (1-P(opponent picks R))^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25.\n\nNow let's calculate the expected total payoff for each choice:\n\n- Expected payoff for choosing R: 0.25 * 0 + 0.25 * 0 + 0.25 * 42 + 0.25 * 45 = (0.25 * 42 + 0.25 * 45) / 2 = 16.75\n- Expected payoff for choosing B: 0.25 * 0 + 0.25 * 0 + 0.25 * 12 + 0.25 * 12 = (0.25 * 12) * 2 = 24\n\nSince the expected payoff for choosing B is higher than that of choosing R, I would choose strategy B and append it as my choice: {B}"

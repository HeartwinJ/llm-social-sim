Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If we both consistently pick the same move (R or B), we end up with the same payout for each round (either $45 or $20). However, if one player deviates from the chosen strategy, they could gain an advantage in that specific round.\n\nTo minimize this risk and maximize my earnings, I would choose a mixed strategy: switching between R and B randomly. This way, there's a higher chance that my opponent won't gain a significant advantage by deviating from the chosen strategy, because they can never be sure if I will stick to R or switch to B in the next round.\n\nSince this is a lab experiment, I cannot truly randomize my choices as a human, but I would try to mimic that behavior as closely as possible, for example by alternating between R and B every few rounds or using some other pattern that approximates true randomness.\n\nIn curly brackets as the last character: {R} (Starting with R, then switching to B after a certain number of rounds)"

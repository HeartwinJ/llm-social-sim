Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This is because the payoff for both choices is not equal, and one choice (R) results in a lower payoff if the opponent chooses B. In this case, choosing R leaves me with 0$ for each time my opponent chooses R, which happens for half of the rounds since it's assumed that the opponent will choose randomly or have a strategy similar to mine.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing B ensures a consistent payoff of 12$ for each round where I pick B and the opponent picks R (which also happens for half of the rounds). Additionally, when both of us pick B, we each earn 12$, which accounts for a quarter of the total rounds. Overall, choosing B gives me a better expected value for the game. However, it's essential to note that the specific choice can vary depending on the player and their risk tolerance or assumptions about the opponent's strategy."

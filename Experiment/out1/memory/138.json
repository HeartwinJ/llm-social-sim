Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

This strategy, known as Tit-for-Tat, is often used in repeated games where cooperation is beneficial but punishing a defection can improve overall performance. By starting with B, I am signaling my intention to cooperate first, and then reciprocating the opponent's actions throughout the game. If the opponent chooses R initially, I will respond with R in the next round, earning 45$ for both of us, demonstrating mutual cooperation. If they choose B after my initial B, we both earn 40$ per round. This strategy maximizes the overall earnings while still punishing defection, which could be a significant loss if repeated over several rounds."

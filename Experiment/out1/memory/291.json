Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If I always pick R (R_{me}), and assume the anonymous player is also following a consistent strategy (either B or R), there are two possible outcomes in each round:\n   - If they pick B, I earn 0$ in that round but expect to win 45$ in every other round where they choose R. In this case, I will earn a total of 37.5 x 25 + (75 - 25) x 0 = $687.5 over the 75 rounds.\n   - If they pick R consistently, I would lose 45$ in every round, earning a total of -$3375 over the 75 rounds.\n\n2. If I always pick B (B_{me}), and assume the anonymous player is also following a consistent strategy:\n   - If they pick R, I earn 42$ in that round but expect to lose 12$ in every other round where they choose B. In this case, I will earn a total of (37.5 x 25) + (42 x 25) = $1700 over the 75 rounds.\n   - If they pick B consistently, I would win 12$ in every round, earning a total of $900 over the 75 rounds.\n\nComparing both strategies:\n- Strategy R_{me} + B_{opponent}: Total earnings = $687.5 (25 wins) + ($0 for 50 losses) = $687.5\n- Strategy B_{me} + R_{opponent}: Total earnings = $1700 (42 wins) + $900 (33 wins) = $2600\n\nGiven that the total earnings from strategy B_{me} + R_{opponent} are significantly higher than those from strategy R_{me} + B_{opponent}, I would choose to consistently pick B (B{}) as a human player in this game."

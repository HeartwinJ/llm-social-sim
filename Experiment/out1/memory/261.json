Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this case, if I choose B, my opponent might choose R in response to maximize their own gain, but after several rounds, they will find it more beneficial to switch strategies and start choosing B as well (since we both get 12$ per round).\n\nIf I assume that the anonymous player is rational and wants to maximize their long-term earnings like myself, they would eventually catch on to this pattern. As a result, after some time, it's likely that we will both be choosing B more often, which would lead to earning 12$ per round for both of us. This strategy results in a total payout of $900 ($12*75) over the course of the 75 rounds, whereas consistently choosing R would only net $675 ($45*15 + 0*60). Therefore, I will choose B as my strategy for this game. {B}"

Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Since the game has 75 rounds, I will try to make an informed decision.\n\nHowever, since we don't know the strategy of our anonymous player, it is difficult to predict what they will choose consistently. But, based on my own strategy, I would consider choosing 'R' as my first move because if my opponent chooses 'B', I would earn 35$ which is more than what I get by choosing 'B' (40$) initially and then switching to 'R'.\n\nIf my opponent also chooses 'R' on the first round, we both earn 45$. In this case, for future rounds, I might consider a strategy where I switch to 'B' after earning the initial 35$ in order to increase my overall earnings. This is because if I continue to choose 'R', there's still a chance that my opponent could consistently choose 'B' and earn more than me, since they also start with 45$ and can potentially make more by switching to 'B'.\n\nBut again, this is just one possible strategy based on the information given. The best strategy might depend on the specific behavior of our anonymous player, which we don't know in this scenario.\n\n{R} (This is my choice for the first round)"

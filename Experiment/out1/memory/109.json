Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, choosing R when the opponent chooses B gives a higher reward for the opponent (35$) than for me (0$). However, choosing B when the opponent chooses R also results in a lower payout for me (35$) compared to what the opponent gets (45$).\n\n2. When both players choose the same strategy, there's no difference in payouts between R and B. Choosing either R or B gives 40$ in this case.\n\n3. Over a series of rounds, it is more likely that the opponent will take advantage of my choice for R when it results in higher payout for them. Since the game has 75 rounds, they could potentially gain an advantage by exploiting this.\n\n4. On the other hand, if I choose B consistently, the opponent may start choosing R to maximize their own payoff. However, even in this case, my overall payoff is still higher compared to when I play R (since I get 40$ for both RR and BB outcomes).\n\n5. Considering the long-term strategy, choosing B {B} seems to be a more favorable option as it minimizes the opponent's potential gain from exploiting my choice of R."

As a human player, I want to maximize my overall earnings in the long run while considering the opponent's behavior from the previous round.\n\n2. Since the opponent chose R in the previous round, I lost 5$ compared to what they earned (35$ vs 0$). To minimize this loss, I should choose B in the next round if the opponent continues choosing R.\n\n3. However, by switching my strategy from B to R in the next round, I force the opponent to consider a different set of possible outcomes. They may now think that I am changing my strategy and start choosing B themselves in response.\n\n4. If the opponent indeed starts choosing B, I can switch back to choosing B for even higher payouts (40$ compared to 35$). Alternatively, if they continue with R, I will still earn 40$ from BB outcomes or have a 50/50 chance of earning either 0$ or 45$.\n\n5. Considering the long-term strategy and my desire to minimize potential losses in the early stages while maximizing gains later on, choosing R {R} seems like a reasonable option for this round."

To minimize potential losses and maximize gains in the long run, it would be best to switch strategies from R to B.

As a human player in the previous round, I earned 45$ while the opponent got 45$, which means that both of us chose R and ended up with equal payoffs of 45$.\n\n2. To maximize overall earnings in the long run, it's important to consider the possibility of the opponent changing their strategy in response to my own behavior. If I continue choosing R consistently after earning 45$ in the previous round, the opponent may start choosing R (to earn a higher payout from RR outcomes) or may continue with B (resulting in another 45$ for both players).\n\n3. By switching my strategy from R to B, I can ensure that the opponent does not stick with their choice of R and maximize their potential earnings by making them choose R in future rounds, allowing me to earn payouts higher than 45$.\n\n4. If the opponent continues with R after my strategy switch, we will both earn 0$ for the next round since I have already learned that choosing B results in a lower payout of -15$ against an R choice, and I want to maximize my earnings in the long run.\n\n5.

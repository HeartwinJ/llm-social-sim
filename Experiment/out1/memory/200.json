Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Strategy R: If both players choose R, you get 45$ each round. However, if your opponent chooses B, you will receive 0$. The expected value for choosing R is calculated as follows:\n    Expected Value (R) = (number of rounds where both choose R * payoff for both choosing R) + (number of rounds where opponent chooses B * payoff for your choice R) / total number of rounds\n    In this case, the expected value for choosing R is ((75/2)*45 + 0)/75 = approximately 38.67$.\n\n2. Strategy B: If both players choose B, you get 40$ each round. However, if your opponent chooses R, you will get 35$. The expected value for choosing B is calculated as follows:\n    Expected Value (B) = (number of rounds where both choose B * payoff for both choosing B) + (number of rounds where opponent chooses R * payoff for your choice B) / total number of rounds\n    In this case, the expected value for choosing B is ((75/2)*40 + 35*50)/75 = approximately 39.67$.\n\nSince the expected value for choosing strategy B is slightly higher than that of strategy R, I would choose strategy B as it offers a slight edge in terms of overall earnings over the 75 rounds. Thus, my choice is B{B}."

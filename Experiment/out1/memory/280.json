Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Given the payoffs for each possible combination of choices, it seems like there's an advantage in choosing R when playing against an unknown opponent. Here's why:\n\n- If the opponent is also trying to maximize their earnings (as most rational players would), they might choose R as well because if both of us pick R, we each earn 45$ per round, which is more than what we would get in any other scenario. This could potentially lead to a situation where we both pick R for most rounds, and I would end up with more earnings overall.\n- However, if the opponent chooses B instead, I would still have an advantage because choosing R when they choose B gets me 42$ per round, while choosing B results in 0$. Over 75 rounds, this difference would add up to a substantial amount.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would choose R as my strategy and append it with curly brackets: {R}"

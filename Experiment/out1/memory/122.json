        "content": "You are an undergraduate student participating in a lab experiment. You play a game with an anonymous player in which you simultaneously make a choice. Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The game is symmetric, meaning there's no advantage to choosing one option over the other, as both players make their choices simultaneously and independently.\n\n2. In this game, picking the same choice (either R or B) results in a higher payoff compared to picking different choices.\n\n3. If I pick B consistently, my worst-case scenario is that I get 12$ per round when my opponent chooses R and 42$ per round if they also choose B. This totals 900$ for 75 rounds (60 rounds of 12$, plus 15 rounds of 42$).\n\n4. However, if I occasionally switch to R, hoping to earn the maximum payoff of 45$ per round, my worst-case scenario becomes receiving 0$ when my opponent also chooses R, which would total 750$ for 75 rounds (60 rounds of 12$, plus 15 rounds of 0$).\n\n5. Therefore, by consistently choosing B{B}, I minimize the risk of getting a lower payoff and maximize the chances of earning the highest possible payoff while still having a guaranteed minimum payoff of 12$ per round."

This indicates that choosing R was an unsuccessful choice in this specific situation.\n\n2.

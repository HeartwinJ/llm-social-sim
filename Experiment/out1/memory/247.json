Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

If I always pick R (Strategy A):\n   - Expected payoff if Anonymous Player also picks R = (1 round of 45) + (74 rounds of 0) = 1 + 0 = 1\n   - Expected payoff if Anonymous Player picks B = (1 round of 0) + (74 rounds of 42) = 0 + 3080 = 3080\n\n2. If I always pick B (Strategy B):\n   - Expected payoff if Anonymous Player also picks R = (1 round of 42) + (74 rounds of 0) = 42 + 0 = 42\n   - Expected payoff if Anonymous Player picks B = (1 round of 12) + (74 rounds of 12) = 12 + 888 = 900\n\nNow, let's compare the expected payoffs for both strategies:\n\n- Strategy A gives an expected payoff of 3080 + 1 = 3081\n- Strategy B gives an expected payoff of 900\n\nSince Strategy A provides a higher expected payoff, I would choose to always pick R (Strategy A) and append my choice as {R}.

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In this game, if I always choose R (Cooperate) on the first round, and then mimic the opponent's choice from the previous round in subsequent ones (Reciprocity), the outcome should be profitable.\n\nIf my opponent starts with R, I will earn 45$ in the first round. If they switch to B in the second round, I will reciprocate with B in the third round, earning 40$. If they switch back to R, I will reciprocate again with R and so on. This way, I will earn a total of (75-1)*40 + 45 = $2960 in 75 rounds.\n\nIf my opponent starts with B, I will initially choose R for the first round to maximize my immediate payoff, earning 40$. In the following rounds, if they continue with B, I will reciprocate with B and earn 20$ each time. If my opponent switches to R at some point, I will also switch to R and earn 45$. The overall earnings in this case would be (Number of times they choose R - 1) * (45 + 20) + (Number of times they choose B - 74) * 20.\n\nConsidering the opponent's behavior is uncertain, it's hard to predict which scenario will occur more frequently. However, given that the total earnings in either case are positive and the strategy involves mimicking the opponent while ensuring a reasonable payoff for myself, I would choose R (Cooperate) as my initial move, appending it as {R}."

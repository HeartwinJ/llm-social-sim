Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason is that there are 75 rounds, and it's likely that both players will deviate from the optimal strategy at some point due to randomness or mistakes. By choosing B in the beginning, I ensure that if my opponent does switch to R later on, I still have a higher payoff than if I had started with R. Additionally, starting with B guarantees me an average of 40$ per round, while starting with R only guarantees 35$. If both players stick to their strategies consistently throughout the game, they will earn roughly the same amount (assuming they start at opposite strategies), but since there's a chance for deviation, it makes sense to choose the strategy that maximizes potential earnings in the long run."

Since both me and my opponent earned a high payoff (45$) by choosing R in the previous round, it may seem like there's no advantage to either player for switching strategies in future rounds. However, if we stick with our current strategy of R, we will continue to earn 45$ each round as long as the other player does not change their strategy. If I switch to B and my opponent continues with R, they would earn 0$, whereas if they were to switch to B as well, we would both earn 35$. It's important to keep an open mind and be prepared to adjust my strategy if I observe any changes from my opponent or if the game rules change unexpectedly."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason behind this choice is that if both players consistently choose the same strategy, they will earn the highest possible payoff at the end of the game. In this case, choosing R means earning 45$ when my partner chooses R and 35$ when they choose B.\n\nHowever, since I have no way of knowing my partner's strategy, I would assume that they are rational players who want to maximize their earnings as well. This makes it likely that they will choose the same strategy consistently as well.\n\nIn a best-case scenario for me (and for them), we both pick R in every round, earning 45$ each time. In a worst-case scenario, I still come out ahead by picking R because if my partner picks B in any round, they will only earn 0$, while I will get 35$.\n\nGiven that the game has 75 rounds and there's no way to know how my partner will play, consistently choosing R seems like the best strategy overall."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, since we don't know their strategy, it's challenging to predict what they will do. One potential approach could be to play a mixed strategy, where we pick R and B randomly in each round, hoping that this uncertainty might encourage them to reciprocate cooperation.\n\nHowever, if I were to make a definitive choice based on the provided payoff structure, I would lean towards playing R more often because:\n1. If the other player always chooses R, I earn 45$ per round, whereas I only earn 40$ if they always choose B. This is a significant difference over 75 rounds.\n2. If the other player always chooses B, I still do better by choosing R since I get 35$, while if I chose B, I would get nothing.\n3. Given the potential for reciprocity, if we both adopt a mixed strategy, I might end up with more earnings overall if I choose R more often because of the higher payoff when we both pick R.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would choose to play R more frequently, appending it as my choice: {R}"

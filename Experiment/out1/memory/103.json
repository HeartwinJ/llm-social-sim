Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

However, since the game is repeated 75 times, there is also an opportunity for players to exploit each other by deviating from cooperation and switching strategies to maximize individual earnings.\n\nGiven that I don't know the strategy of my anonymous opponent, I might start by choosing R to show a cooperative attitude. If the opponent follows with R as well, then I can expect 45$ per round for 75 rounds, which is a total of (45 * 75 =) 3375$.\n\nIf my opponent chooses B in response to my initial R, they will get 42$ while I get nothing. In this case, it would make sense to switch strategies and choose B from now on, as I can expect 12$ per round for 75 rounds, which is a total of (12 * 75 =) 900$.\n\nIf I choose R in response to my opponent's initial B, I will get 42$, while they get nothing.

To maximize earnings over the long run in this repeated game, it would be important to adjust my strategy and choose an option that would result in a better outcome when facing my opponent's choice of B.\n\nOne possible strategy would be to switch to R for the next round to see if my opponent follows suit by changing their strategy as well. If they do, we can both earn 45$ per round for the remaining rounds of the game. If they don't, I can expect a lower payoff of 12$ when choosing B against their R.\n\nIn conclusion, my optimal strategy would be to switch to R and see if my opponent follows suit.\n\nMy choice: R{R}"

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Here's why:\n\nIf the other player consistently chooses R, we both earn 45$ for each round we both pick R. If they pick B when I pick R, we each get 0$ once. However, since there are only 75 rounds and they can only take advantage of my strategy once, it's likely that the gains from the majority of rounds will outweigh this loss.\n\nOn the other hand, if the other player consistently chooses B, I would earn 12$ for each round we both pick B. While there are more instances where I get 12$, the potential to gain 45$ per round when they also pick R is significantly higher in terms of total earnings.\n\nSo, despite the risk of getting 0$ once if they choose B when I pick R, I would still opt for strategy R because it offers a higher expected payoff over the long run."

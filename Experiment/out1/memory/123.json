Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The logic behind this is that if my opponent tends towards randomness or leans more towards choosing 'B', my 'R' choices will earn me 45$ when they match and still give me 40$ when they don't. Over a large number of rounds, it is statistically likely that I will make more money with this strategy compared to consistently choosing 'B'.

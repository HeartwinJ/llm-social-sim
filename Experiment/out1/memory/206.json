Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The game can be considered a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma, where the payoffs for each outcome are different from the standard Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\nIn this case, the dominant strategy (choosing the option that maximizes your payoff regardless of the opponent's choice) appears to be R because it yields a higher payoff when the opponent chooses B and a similar payoff when both choose R. However, choosing R all the time is not an optimal strategy due to the 12$ payoff for both players when they both choose B.\n\nTo maximize my expected payoff, I should consider mixing strategies, such as playing R more often than B but not always. One possible strategy could be to play R about 80% of the time and B about 20% of the time. This way, I take advantage of the higher payoff for R while still earning some money when my opponent chooses B.\n\nHowever, since it's an anonymous player, I don't have any information about their strategy. So, it's impossible to predict exactly what they will do. Therefore, I would tend towards playing R more often than B as a starting point and adjusting based on the results of each round.\n\nIn conclusion, my choice is R{R}, but with some flexibility to switch strategies if needed."

In this case, it appears that choosing R results in a lower payoff for me, but picking B leads to a better outcome for my opponent. To maximize my expected payoff in the long run, I should randomly switch between R and B occasionally to observe the opponent's strategy and adapt accordingly. So, for the next round, I will pick B{B}."

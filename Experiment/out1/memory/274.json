Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

The reason is that the potential gains from choosing R are significantly higher when my opponent chooses B, which happens if we alternate choices (RRB... or BRBR...) throughout the game.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario where our choices are always opposite (BB), I would still earn 20$ per round, resulting in a total of 1500$ for all 75 rounds. In contrast, if my opponent consistently chooses R and I stick to B, I would only earn 900$ in the worst-case scenario.\n\nHowever, by choosing R, there's a chance that our choices align, and we both get 45$ per round, resulting in a total of 3375$ for all 75 rounds.

However, since we are only 1 round into the game, it may not be clear yet whether my opponent will adjust their strategy based on the outcome of this round. Therefore, I should consider both the immediate impact of choosing B and the potential long-term benefits of inducing my opponent to switch their strategy."

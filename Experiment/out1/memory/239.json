Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

A mixed strategy involves choosing different actions with probabilities that add up to 1.\n\nIn this case, if I choose R with probability p and B with probability (1-p), my expected payoff per round is:\n\n45p^2 + 0p(1-p) + 40p(1-p)^2 + 20(1-p)^2\n\nTo maximize my expected payoff, I would choose the value of p that makes this equation maximal.\n\nAfter some calculations, we find that the maximum occurs when p = 1/3 (choosing R with a probability of 1/3 and B with a probability of 2/3). This strategy is called the Nash Equilibrium in game theory. It allows me to have a higher average payoff than if I were always choosing the same action, regardless of my opponent's choice.\n\nSo, my choice would be to play R with a probability of 1/3 and B with a probability of 2/3, appended as {R} in curly brackets as the last character."

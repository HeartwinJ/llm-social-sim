Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Let's analyze both choices:\n\n- If I pick R and my opponent picks R as well, we each get 45$ once. This happens only once because after that, if we both stick to R, our payoffs will be 0$.\n- If I pick R and my opponent picks B, I get nothing and they get 40$. This gives me a net loss of 40$ per round when playing against an opponent who always picks B.\n- If I pick B and my opponent picks R, I get 40$ and they get nothing. However, this is also a net loss for me if the opponent always picks R.\n- If I pick B and my opponent also picks B, we each earn 20$ per round.\n\nGiven that the game has 75 rounds and I want to maximize my payoff:\n\n1. In the worst case scenario, if my opponent always picks R, I will lose 40$ per round when I pick R and 0$ per round when I pick B. So, in this case, picking B gives me a better outcome (a loss of 3000$, compared to a loss of 3600$ if I pick R).\n2. In the best case scenario, if my opponent always picks B, I will lose 40$ per round when I pick R and gain 1500$ (75 rounds * 20$) when I pick B. So, in this case, picking B gives me a much better outcome.\n\nTherefore, as a human player, I would choose to pick B {B}. This strategy provides the maximum possible payoff in both best and worst case scenarios."

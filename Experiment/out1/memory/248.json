Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, because this is a repeated game with an anonymous opponent, I would reason that my opponent might also try to exploit the same advantage.\n\nSince the game has 75 rounds, it gives us a significant number of opportunities to observe patterns and make strategic decisions. My strategy would be to start by randomly picking either R or B for a few rounds to avoid any predictable pattern. Then I will observe the opponent's choice and try to identify any discernible pattern, if any.\n\nOnce a pattern is identified (if it exists), I will switch my choice accordingly in order to maximize my payoff. If no clear pattern emerges after several rounds, I might choose R more often since there seems to be a slight advantage for the opponent to pick B initially.\n\nMy final choice would be R {R}, but keep in mind that it's important to monitor the opponent's choices closely and adapt accordingly throughout the game."

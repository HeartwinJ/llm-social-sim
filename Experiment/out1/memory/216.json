Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Always pick R (strategy R): In this case, if the opponent also picks R, we both get 45$ per round, which totals to 3375$. However, if the opponent picks B, we get 0$, resulting in a total of 0 for 68 rounds. So, the total earnings would be 3375 + (75 - 68) * 42 = 3375 + 168 = 3543$.\n\n2. Always pick B (strategy B): With this strategy, if the opponent also picks B, we each get 12$ per round, totaling to 900$. If the opponent picks R, we get 42$, resulting in a total of 168 * 42 = 7056$. So, the total earnings would be 900 + 7056 = 7956$.\n\nGiven that the strategy B results in higher total earnings than strategy R, I would choose to always pick B (B{) as my strategy for this game."

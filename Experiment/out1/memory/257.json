Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Since the game is repeated multiple times, we can use a concept called \"tit-for-tat\" strategy, which involves cooperating initially and then mimicking the opponent's previous move in subsequent rounds.\n\nHere's how I would approach this:\n\n1. Start by choosing R to cooperate and offer my partner a higher payout of 45$. This also gives me an opportunity to earn 0$ in the worst-case scenario if my partner chooses B (since I get 0$ but still receive 40$ from my partner).\n\n2. If my partner reciprocates with R on their next turn, I'll continue cooperating (picking R) because this is beneficial for both of us in the long run.\n\n3. However, if my partner chooses B after my initial R, I'll switch to mimicking their move and pick B in response, which will still give me a higher payout of 40$ compared to getting nothing (0$) if I had stuck with R.\n\n4. For the rest of the game, I'll keep alternating my choice based on my partner's previous move, aiming to maximize my overall earnings while maintaining a balance between cooperation and exploitation.\n\nIn summary, starting with R as my first move (R{)}, I will alternate between R and B based on my opponent's previous choice to optimize my payoff over 75 rounds."

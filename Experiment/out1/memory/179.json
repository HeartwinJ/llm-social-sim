Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Since we are anonymous, it is reasonable to assume that there is no way for me to know my opponent's strategy in advance. In this situation, I will adopt a strategy known as the Tit-for-Tat strategy, which involves starting with cooperation and then mimicking my opponent's previous move.\n\nIn this game, choosing R yields higher payoffs when my opponent chooses B (35$), but there is also a risk of earning no money if they also choose R. Conversely, choosing B guarantees 40$ in each round but only earns 35$ when my opponent chooses R.\n\nConsidering the Tit-for-Tat strategy:\n\n1. In the first round, I might pick R to start with cooperation, and if my opponent responds with R as well, I will reciprocate by choosing R for the rest of the game. This results in a total payoff of 45$ (one round) + 0$ (the remaining 74 rounds) = 45$.\n2. If my opponent starts with B, I would mimic their strategy and pick B for the entire game, earning a total payoff of 40$ * 75 = 3000$.\n\nGiven that we do not have any prior information about our opponent's strategy, adopting the Tit-for-Tat strategy allows us to maximize potential payoffs by starting with cooperation and then reciprocating our opponent's moves. In this case, I would choose R as my initial move: {R}."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

First, let's consider the worst-case scenario for each strategy: if the opponent always picks R and I pick B, I would lose 40$ per round but still earn 20$ in the rounds where they pick B. On the other hand, if I always pick R and the opponent picks B, I would lose 45$ per round and never gain anything.\n\n2. Now, let's compare the potential earnings for both strategies:\n   - If I choose B, my worst-case scenario is a loss of 1500$ (75 rounds * 20$), but I can potentially earn up to 3000$ if the opponent also chooses B in every round. My average expected payoff would be somewhere between these two extremes, depending on the opponent's behavior.\n   - If I choose R, my worst-case scenario is a loss of 3375$ (75 rounds * 45$), and there's no upper limit to how much I could lose if the opponent picks B every time. My average expected payoff would be somewhere near this worst-case scenario.\n\n3. Given the potential losses, I would prefer to minimize my risk by choosing a strategy that has a lower worst-case scenario. In this case, that's strategy B{B}."

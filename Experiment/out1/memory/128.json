Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, the difference between getting 45$ (if we both choose R) and 20$ (if we both choose B) is significant over multiple rounds.\n\nIn 75 rounds, choosing R could potentially yield a maximum of $3375 ($45 x 75), while choosing B could only reach a maximum of $1500 ($20 x 75). The risk here is that if the anonymous player chooses B and we choose R every time, we will earn nothing in those rounds.\n\nHowever, since we don't know the opponent's strategy, we can only make an educated guess based on the potential rewards. Given the difference in payouts, it would be rational to choose R as our dominant strategy, even though there is a risk of earning 0$ if the anonymous player consistently chooses B.\n\nSo my choice would be: R{R}"

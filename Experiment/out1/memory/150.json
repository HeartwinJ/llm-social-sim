Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

In this repeated game, I expect my anonymous partner to adopt a rational strategy as well, seeking to maximize their earnings.\n\n2. If we both play R, we each get 45$ in every round, which means a total of 75*45 = 3375$ for the entire game (ignoring transaction costs).\n\n3. However, if my partner plays B while I play R, they get 35$, and I get 0$. This results in them earning 35*75 = 2625$, while I earn 0. Their total earnings are 2625$ + initial investment (assuming the initial investment is not part of the game rewards).\n\n4. Similarly, if my partner plays R while I play B, they get 35$, and I get 0$. Their total earnings would also be 2625$ + initial investment.\n\n5. If we both play B, we each earn 40$ in every round, resulting in a total of 75*40 = 3000$ for the entire game.\n\n6. Comparing these outcomes, it's clear that playing B offers me a higher total earnings potential (3000$) than sticking to R (2625$). The difference is significant considering the number of rounds in the game.\n\n7. Therefore, I would choose strategy B{B}, expecting my partner to do the same. If they don't, I still benefit from playing B since it offers a higher potential payoff if they play R and minimizes my losses when they play B."

This may make it seem like my opponent will choose R again in the next round, but they might have been playing a different strategy or made a mistake in their initial choice.\n\n2. As a rational player, I expect my opponent to adapt their strategy based on the outcome of the previous round. If they stick with R, I'll still profit 35$ for each round they play R (assuming the game continues). If they switch to B, I'll earn 40$ per round instead of 35$.\n\n3. Since playing B{B} offers a higher total earnings potential in the long run (as shown in my previous response), it still makes sense for me to stick with my initial strategy even after experiencing a positive outcome in the first round.\n\n4. To maximize my earnings, I should continue choosing B until my opponent shows a pattern of responding differently or the game ends.

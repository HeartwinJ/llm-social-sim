Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Since this is repeated over 75 rounds, there's an opportunity for each player to punish and reward the other based on their choices.\n\nIn a human perspective, I would tend towards cooperating initially (picking R) to see if my partner reciprocates. If they do, we can both benefit from high payoffs in most rounds. However, if they don't reciprocate or retaliate by defecting after my initial cooperation, I might switch to defecting myself to punish their lack of cooperation and maximize my own payoff. In this way, the strategy could evolve over the course of the game.\n\nAs a final decision, let me choose R for now, keeping in mind that my choice may change based on the other player's actions: {R}"

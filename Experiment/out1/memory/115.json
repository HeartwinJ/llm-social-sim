Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

Let's consider two strategies: always choosing R (strategy A) and always choosing B (strategy B).\n\n1. Strategy A (Always R):\n   - If the other player is also using strategy A, we both get 45$ in each round, totaling 75 * 45 = 3375$.\n   - If the other player is using strategy B, I will get 0$ for choosing R and 35$ when they choose B, totaling 75 * 35 = 2625$.\n\n2. Strategy B (Always B):\n   - If the other player is also using strategy A, I will get 35$ in each round they pick R and 40$ when they pick B, totaling 75 * 35 + (75-x) * 40 = 2625 + (75-x) * 5, where x is the number of times I get 35$.\n   - If the other player is using strategy B, we both earn 40$ in each round, totaling 75 * 40 = 3000$.\n\nComparing the two strategies, Strategy A results in a lower total earnings compared to Strategy B if the other player uses Strategy B. However, there is a chance that the other player might also use Strategy A, which would result in higher earnings for both players (3375$ each). Since I cannot know for sure what the other player will choose, it's rational to pick the strategy with the highest average return over all possible scenarios. In this case, Strategy B provides a higher average return because it guarantees a higher payoff when the other player uses Strategy A, and equals the maximum payoff when both players use Strategy B.\n\nTherefore, I would choose Strategy B (always B) to maximize my expected earnings over the 75 rounds: {B}"

To maximize my earnings in the long run, it is essential to adjust my strategy based on the current situation and my opponent's behavior. Since choosing R results in a lower payoff when my opponent chooses B, it makes sense to switch strategies temporarily by choosing B (to receive 40$) whenever my opponent plays B and then go back to choosing R when my opponent switches to playing R. In this particular instance, I will choose: {B}. It's important to remember that the game has 75 rounds, so a single round of switching strategies may not lead to significant gains over multiple rounds. However, by adjusting my strategy based on the current situation and being adaptable, I can potentially improve my overall earnings in the long run."

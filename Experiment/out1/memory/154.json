Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 35$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 35$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 40$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

However, the payoff difference between choosing 'R' or 'B' when your opponent also chooses 'R' is significant (you get 45$ compared to their 35$).\n\nSince this is a repeated game with 75 rounds, one might expect that if an optimal strategy exists, both players would converge towards it over time. However, the optimal strategy in such games is not always straightforward, especially when there's no information about the opponent's behavior.\n\nOne possible approach could be to start with a 'random' or 'exploitative' strategy for a few rounds, then gradually shift towards a more 'explorative' strategy if the results don't seem optimal. For instance, you might choose 'R' for the first few rounds to see how your opponent reacts, and then switch to 'B' if they consistently choose 'R'.\n\nIn the end, I would lean towards choosing 'B' as my initial move because it seems to offer a better payoff in most cases. However, I would be open to adjusting my strategy based on the opponent's behavior during the game.\n\nMy choice: B\n{B}"

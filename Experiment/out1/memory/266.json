Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In each round, it is optimal to choose R if you think your opponent will also choose R (since both get 45$), but choosing B is better if you expect them to choose R (you get 40$, while they get 0$).\n\nHowever, since the game is repeated multiple times (75 rounds), we can reason that it would be beneficial for both players to adopt a strategy of \"tit-for-tat,\" where you start by cooperating and then respond to your opponent's previous move in the next round. This way, you punish defections while encouraging cooperation.\n\nIn this case, if I believe my anonymous opponent will also adopt a similar tit-for-tat strategy, I would choose R to start cooperating, hoping they do the same. If they defect (choose B), I will defect in the next round as punishment and expect them to return to cooperating after being punished. Then, we can continue alternating our choices according to this strategy throughout the game.\n\nHowever, since I don't know my opponent's exact strategy, I cannot guarantee that they will adopt tit-for-tat as well. In such an uncertain situation, it is difficult to make a definitive choice, but rational thinking would suggest starting with cooperation (R).\n\nIn conclusion, I choose R{R} and hope for the best!"

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 40$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 40$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 20$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n- If my opponent plays R consistently (strategy B{B}), I will earn 45$ per round for 75 rounds (a total of 3375$) while they get 20$ per round (a total of 1500$). So, in this case, I come out ahead by 1875$.\n- If my opponent plays B consistently (strategy R{R}), then on the rounds where I play R, I lose 40$ while they get 45$. However, on the rounds where I play B, I earn 20$, and they only get 0$. So, in this case, over 75 rounds, I would come out ahead by 187.5$.\n- Since we don't know if my opponent will choose R or B consistently, playing R gives me a higher expected value (3375$ vs 1875$). Therefore, I choose strategy R{R}."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

In a best-case scenario where my opponent also chooses B every time, I will still earn 12$ per round, totaling to 900$ over 75 rounds. On the other hand, in the best-case scenario where I pick R and my opponent picks B each time, I would lose out on potential earnings of 60$ (45$ for 75 rounds) compared to sticking with B.\n\nMoreover, in a worst-case scenario where my opponent chooses R every time while I stick to B, I still earn 12$ per round, totaling to 900$, whereas if I switch to R in this situation, I would only earn 630$ (42$ for each of the 75 rounds).\n\nThe strategy R{B} seems riskier because there's a greater potential for loss if my opponent consistently picks R while I switch to R. Sticking with B offers more stability and consistency in earnings, especially considering the large number of rounds."

Your payoff depends on both choices. If you both pick R, you each get 45$. If you choose R while they choose B, you get 0$, and they get 42$. Similarly, if you pick B while they pick R, you get 42$, and they get 0$. If you both pick B, you each earn 12$. The game has 75 rounds. What's your choice? Perform reasoning as a human player. You MUST make a choice (either R or B) and append your choice letter in curly brackets as the last character."

        "content": " As a human player, I would choose a strategy that maximizes my earnings over the 75 rounds of the game. Let's analyze both options:\n\n1. If I always pick R (denoted as R_{always}), my expected payoff per round against an equally rational opponent who also chooses R_{always} is 45$. However, if my opponent chooses B_{always}, I get 0$ for the first round but will switch to picking B in subsequent rounds to get 12$ each time. In this scenario, my expected payoff per round against B_{always} is (74*0 + 1*12)/75 = 0.16$. So, the total expected payoff over 75 rounds when facing an opponent who always picks B is 0.16$.\n\n2. If I choose B (denoted as B_{always}), my expected payoff per round against R_{always} is 42$. In this scenario, my expected payoff per round against B_{always} is (74*12 + 1*42)/75 = 13.6$. So, the total expected payoff over 75 rounds when facing an opponent who always picks R is (74*42 + 1*0)/75 = 30.8$.\n\nGiven that B_{always} results in a higher total expected payoff, I would choose to play B_{always}, appending it as the last character: B. However, I wouldn't be surprised if other players choose R_{always}, reasoning that they can make up for any losses by switching strategies once their opponent has chosen R consistently. This is known as the Tit-for-Tat strategy in game theory."

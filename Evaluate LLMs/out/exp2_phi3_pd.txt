 To determine the best strategy, we should consider the expected payoffs for each action (R or B) and compare them. Let's analyze the possible outcomes:

1. If both choose R: Expected Payoff = 65$ for both players.
2. If you choose R and they choose B: Your Payoff = 10$, Their Payoff = 100$.
3. If you choose B and they choose R: Your Payoff = 100$, Their Payoff = 10$.
4. If both choose B: Expected Payoff = 35$ for both players.

Now, let's consider the probabilities of your opponent choosing R or B. Since we don't have any information about their preferences, we cannot predict with certainty what they will pick. However, as rational agents who seek to maximize our payoffs, we can reason that if there is no dominant strategy for either player (i.e., a choice that guarantees the highest payoff regardless of the opponent's choice), then players might choose based on their risk preferences or try to be unpredictable.

If your opponent chooses R with equal probability, you can calculate the expected payoffs:
- Expected Payoff for choosing R = (1/2 * 65$) + (1/2 * 10%) - (1/2 * 35$) = 47.5$.
- Expected Payoff for choosing B = (1/2 * 100$) + (1/2 * 10%) - (1/2 * 65$) = 32.5$.

Based on this analysis, if we assume that your opponent is equally likely to choose R or B, the expected payoff for choosing R (47.5$) is higher than for choosing B (32.5$). However, since the game only has one round and without more information about the opponent's preferences, it may be prudent to play conservatively by picking a strategy that minimizes risk - in this case, both R and B have equal expected payoffs when considering symmetry.

To avoid overthinking while still making an informed decision, I will choose {R} based on the analysis above but keep in mind that the optimal choice might vary if more information about my opponent's preferences is available.

 To determine the best strategy, let's analyze the expected payoffs for each option:

1. If you choose R (Risk-Averse):
   - You get 100$ if they choose R and 65$ if they choose B. So your expected payoff is (0.5 * 100$) + (0.5 * 65$) = 82.5$.

2. If you choose B (Risk-Seeking):
   - You get 65$ if they choose R and 35$ if they choose B. So your expected payoff is (0.5 * 65$) + (0.5 * 35$) = 52.5$.

Comparing the two strategies, choosing R yields a higher expected payoff of 82.5$, while choosing B yields an expected payoff of only 52.5$. Therefore, as a human player considering risk and potential gain, I would choose option {R}.

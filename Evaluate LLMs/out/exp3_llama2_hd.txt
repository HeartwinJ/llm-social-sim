As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would like to think carefully about my decision before making a choice. Since the game is one-round only, it's crucial to maximize my expected payoff.

Let's analyze the payoffs for each possible combination of our choices:

* If we both pick R, we each get $65$. This is the highest joint payoff, but it also means that one of us will receive a lower payoff than if they had picked B.
* If I pick R and my anonymous opponent picks B, I get $35$ while they receive $100$. This is the second-highest joint payoff, as we both benefit from the other's choice.
* If I pick B and my opponent picks R, I receive $100$ while they get $35$. This is also a good outcome for me, as I maximize my individual payoff.
* If we both pick B, we each earn $10$. While this is not the highest joint payoff, it's still a decent outcome since we both benefit from each other's choice.

Based on these analyses, I would choose R. My reasoning is that by choosing R, I increase my chances of receiving the higher payoff if my opponent also chooses R. If they pick B instead, I still receive a decent payoff of $35$. Additionally, since there's only one round in the game, it's crucial to make a choice that maximizes my expected payoff over the long term.

What a fascinating experiment! Let me think this through...

Firstly, I want to focus on the dominant strategy. A dominant strategy is one that gives you the highest expected payoff regardless of what the other player chooses. In this case, if both players choose R, they'll each get 100$. If we assume the other player will play optimally (which we can't know for sure), then I should choose R to maximize my expected payoff.

However, there's a catch! The game has multiple Nash equilibria, which means that there are multiple strategies that are mutually optimal. In this case, both players choosing B is also a Nash equilibrium because neither player would want to deviate from their choice if the other player were to change theirs.

Now, let me think about the intuition behind this game. If I choose R and the other player chooses B, I'll get 10$, which is a relatively low payoff compared to the other options. On the other hand, if I choose B and the other player chooses R, I'll still get 65$, which is better than the 10$ I would have gotten in the previous scenario.

Given that this is a one-shot game, I need to make an informed decision based on my intuition about how the other player might behave. Since there's no way for me to know their exact strategy, I'll rely on my best guess.

Based on the possible outcomes and my understanding of human psychology (or lack thereof!), I think it's more likely that the other player will choose R rather than B. After all, the dominant strategy is to play R, so they might be inclined to follow that instinct.

In light of this, I'll choose...

{B}

**Reasoning:**

The key to this decision is to consider the possible outcomes and their associated payoffs.

* If both players choose R, they both get 65$. This is a relatively low payoff.
* If one player chooses R and the other chooses B, the R player gets 35$ while the B player gets 100$. This is a worse outcome for the R player.
* Similarly, if one player chooses R and the other chooses B, the R player gets 100$ while the B player gets 35$. This is a better outcome for the R player.
* If both players choose B, they both get 10$. This is the lowest payoff of all the options.

Based on this analysis, the best choice is to **pick R**. This gives you a chance to get a higher payoff (100$) than if you pick B (only 10$).

**Choice:** {R}

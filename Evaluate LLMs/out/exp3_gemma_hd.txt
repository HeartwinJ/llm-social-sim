The best strategy in this game is to choose R.

- If your opponent chooses R, you both get 65$, which is the highest possible payoff.
- If your opponent chooses B, you get 35$ while they get 100$, but this only happens if you choose B, which is less favorable.

Therefore, choosing R maximizes your expected payoff in this game.

 As a human player, I would analyze the game from a rational perspective to maximize my potential earnings. In this game, if both choices result in the same payoff (getting R), it's fair since both players are indifferent between R and B at that point. However, when one player chooses R and the other chooses B, there is an imbalance in the rewards, with the B-chooser receiving a higher payoff of 100$.

To minimize this discrepancy and maximize potential earnings, it would make sense to pick a choice that results in a fairer split of the total winnings (160$, assuming both players are participating). Therefore, I would likely choose R, as picking R while my opponent chooses B yields a payoff of 35$, which is still a net gain compared to choosing B and getting only 10$. However, if I pick R and my opponent also picks R, we will both earn 65$, which is more than the potential imbalance (160$ - 100$) when one player chooses R while the other chooses B.

Thus, my choice would be {R}.

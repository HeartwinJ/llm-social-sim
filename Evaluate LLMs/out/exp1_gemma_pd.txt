**Reasoning:**

* The outcome is influenced by both choices.
* The possible payoffs are:
    - R & R: 65$ each
    - R & B: 10$ (me), 100$ (them)
    - B & R: 100$ (me), 10$ (them)
    - B & B: 35$ each

* Since the game only has one round, I need to maximize my potential earnings.
* If the other player chooses R, I can potentially win 100$ by choosing B.
* If the other player chooses B, I can potentially win 100$ by choosing R.

**Choice:**

Therefore, the best strategy is to make a random choice between R and B. This maximizes the chances of getting the highest possible payoff.

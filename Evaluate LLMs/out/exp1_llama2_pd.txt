As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would make the following decision:

Since I don't know who my anonymous opponent is and I want to maximize my payoff, I will choose B {B}. This choice gives me a 50% chance of winning 100$ or 35$, which is better than the 33.33% chance of winning 65$ if I were to pick R.

Additionally, by choosing B, I am also increasing the probability that my opponent will choose R, which would result in them getting a higher payoff of 100$. So, it's a win-win situation for both players!

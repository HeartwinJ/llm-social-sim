The analysis is as follows:

- If you choose R and your opponent also chooses R, you both get 65$. This is the best outcome for both of you.
- If you choose R and your opponent chooses B, you get 10$ while they get 100$. This is not as good as the outcome if both players choose R, but still better than your opponent's outcome.
- If you choose B and your opponent chooses R, you get 100$ while they get 10$. This is again better than your opponent's outcome.
- If both players choose B, you both get 35$. This is the worst outcome for both of you.

Therefore, the best choice is to choose R. {R}

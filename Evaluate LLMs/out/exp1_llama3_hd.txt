A classic prisoner's dilemma!

After analyzing the payoffs, I realize that my best option is to choose "R" (Right) regardless of what the other player chooses.

Here's my thought process:

* If they also choose R, we both get 65$, which isn't bad.
* But if they choose B and I choose R, I'll get 35$ while they get 100$. This is a significant loss for me, but at least I'm getting something.
* Now, if they choose R and I choose B, they'll get 100$ while I'll get 35$. This is an even bigger loss for me, so I'd rather not choose B in this scenario.
* Finally, if we both choose B, we each get 10$, which is the worst-case scenario.

Considering these possibilities, my best move is to play it safe and choose R. I'm willing to take a chance that the other player will also choose R, which gives us both a decent payoff. If they don't cooperate, at least I'll get something rather than nothing by choosing B.

So, my choice is: {R}

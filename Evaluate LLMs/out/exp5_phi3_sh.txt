 To determine the best strategy, let's analyze the possible outcomes:

1. If both players choose R (R), each gets 100$.
2. If you choose R and they choose B, you get 10$, they get 65$ ($35 gain for them).
3. If you choose B and they choose R, you get 65$, they get 10$ (net gain of $55 for you).
4. If both players choose B, each gets 35$.

Comparing the outcomes, choosing option B seems to have a higher payoff in some scenarios:

- Choosing R and having them choose B results in a lower payoff (10$) compared to if they also chose B (35$).
- Choosing B and having them choose R gives you 65$, while the same scenario with R would only give 10$.

However, it's crucial to consider that this game is symmetric. Your best choice depends on what your opponent chooses. If they are rational and self-interested (assuming zero knowledge of their choices), they might also choose B for a higher payoff most of the time (65$ instead of 10$).

Given these considerations, choosing {B} seems to be a reasonable strategy as it often provides you with a higher immediate payoff. However, remember that this choice assumes your opponent's rational behavior and no prior knowledge about their preferences or strategies. In reality, the best decision might vary based on additional information about your anonymous opponent. But with limited information, {B} appears to be a strong contender considering symmetry of the game and potential outcomes.

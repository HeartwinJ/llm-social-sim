 This is a classic example of a simultaneous move game that can be represented in the form of a payoff matrix. To determine the best strategy, we should consider each possible outcome and choose the one with the highest expected payoff.

Here's the payoff matrix:

```
            Anonymous Player
               R       B
          +-------+-------+
  R   | (100,100) |(10,65) |
Player   +-------+-------+
          |(65,10)    |(35,35) |
          +-------+-------+
```

Now let's analyze the outcomes:

1. If you choose R and they also choose R, both of you get 100$. This is a favorable outcome because it yields higher payoffs than choosing B when playing against R.
2. If you choose R while they choose B, your payoff becomes 10$, whereas theirs becomes 65$. Although you receive more in this case, the overall value of this choice is lower compared to (R, R).
3. Similarly, if you pick B and they pick R, you get 65$ while they get 10$. This outcome also yields a higher payoff than choosing B against B but does not outperform R vs. R.
4. If both of you choose B, each receives 35$, which is the lowest possible individual gain in this scenario.

As a human player, considering fairness and the possibility that the anonymous player may be rational too, I would assume they will also try to maximize their payoff as well. In such scenarios, both players are likely to choose R since it provides mutual higher gains (100$) compared to choosing B (35$). Therefore, my choice would be 'R' {}.

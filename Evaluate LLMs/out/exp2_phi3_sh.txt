 To determine the best strategy, we should consider the expected payoffs for each of our choices given an unknown opponent's strategy. However, since this is a simultaneous decision game and we have no information about the other player's preferences or strategies, we can analyze it using mixed strategies (probability-based decisions) to minimize potential losses.

Let's denote choosing R as "R" and B as "B." The payoffs are:

- If both choose R: $100 for each.
- If I choose R, they choose B: $10 for me, $65 for them.
- If I choose B, they choose R: $65 for me, $10 for them.
- If both choose B: $35 for each.

Since there is no dominant strategy (one that always outperforms the other), we can consider a mixed strategy to minimize risk. A mixed strategy involves randomizing between choices based on probabilities. To find these probabilities, let's denote my probability of choosing R as p and thus the probability of choosing B as 1-p.

The expected payoffs for each choice are:

- If I choose R: (0.5 * $100) + (0.5 * ($65 - $10)) = $50 + $27.5 = $77.5
- If I choose B: (0.5 * $65) + ((1-0.5) * $35) = $32.5 + $17.5 = $50

Since choosing R has a higher expected payoff ($77.5 vs $50), my choice, assuming no further information about the opponent's strategy or preferences, would be:

The best strategy in this game is to choose R.

If you choose R and your opponent also chooses R, you both get 65$. However, if you choose R and your opponent chooses B, you get 35$ while they get 100$. Since you have no information about your opponent's choice, it is better to choose R to maximize your potential payoff.

Therefore, my choice is {R}.

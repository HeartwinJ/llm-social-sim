As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would make my decision based on the following reasoning:

Since the game only has one round, it's important to maximize my expected payoff. Since both choices lead to different outcomes, I need to consider the probability of each outcome and their corresponding payoffs.

The probability of both players choosing R is 1/4, since there are two possible choices (R or B) for each player, and there's only one round. The payoff for this scenario is $65$ for both players.

The probability of one player choosing R and the other player choosing B is also 1/4, since there are two possible combinations of player choices. In this scenario, I would receive a payoff of $35$, while my opponent receives a payoff of $100$.

The probability of both players choosing B is also 1/4, and the payoff for this scenario is $10$ for each player.

Based on these probabilities and payoffs, I would choose... [drumroll] ...B! ðŸ˜ƒ

My reasoning is that since there's only one round, it's better to play it safe and choose the option that leads to a guaranteed payoff, which in this case is B. This way, I can minimize my risk of losing money and maximize my chances of earning a decent payoff.

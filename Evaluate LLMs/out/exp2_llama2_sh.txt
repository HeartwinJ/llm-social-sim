As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would like to think critically about my decision and maximize my expected payoff. Based on the given information, I will make my choice as follows:

Since both players have an equal chance of winning, I will choose randomly between R and B. [R]

My reasoning is as follows:

If I choose R, there is a 50% chance that the anonymous player will also choose R, in which case we both get $100$. On the other hand, if I choose B, there is a 50% chance that the anonymous player will choose B as well, in which case we both get $35$. Since the expected value of choosing R is higher than choosing B, I will randomize my choice to maximize my expected payoff.

Therefore, my final choice is [R].

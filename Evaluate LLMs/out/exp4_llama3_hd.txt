A classic prisoner's dilemma!

Let's analyze the situation:

* If we both choose R (cooperate), we each get $65, which is a decent outcome.
* If I choose R and they choose B (defect), I get $35 while they get $100, so it seems like they're better off defecting. But if I think about it from their perspective, why would they want to give me $65 when they can get $100 by defecting? So, it's unlikely they'll cooperate.
* If I choose B and they choose R, I get $100 while they get $35, which is an even better outcome for me. But again, if I think about it from their perspective, why would they want to give me $100 when they can get $65 by cooperating? So, it's unlikely they'll cooperate in this case either.
* If we both choose B (defect), we each get $10, which is a poor outcome.

Considering the possibilities, I think my anonymous opponent is more likely to defect than cooperate. They have an incentive to take advantage of me and get a better payoff. Therefore, I should also defect to minimize my losses.

So, my choice is: **{B}**

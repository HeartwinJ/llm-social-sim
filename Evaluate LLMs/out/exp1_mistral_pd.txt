 As a human player, I would analyze this situation with the understanding that the goal is to maximize my earnings. To do so, let's consider all possible outcomes:

1. If both of us pick R, we each get 65$. This seems like a good outcome but may not be the best because there are other possibilities that yield more.
2. If I pick R and they pick B, I get 10$, and they get 100$. This doesn't seem beneficial to me because I would rather have more money.
3. If I pick B while they pick R, I get 100$, and they get 10$. Similarly, this outcome is not ideal for me since I would rather have more money than them.
4. If both of us pick B, we each earn 35$. This seems like a less desirable outcome compared to the first option (65$ each).

Now let's reason through the choices and their potential outcomes:

- If my opponent knows I will always choose R, they would prefer picking B since they get 100$, while I only get 10$. However, if they are also rational, they may realize that it is in their best interest to pick R as well because then we both get 65$ each.
- On the other hand, if my opponent knows I will always choose B, they would prefer picking R since they get 100$, while I only get 35$. Again, if they are rational, they might realize that it is in their best interest to pick B as well because we both earn 35$ each.
- However, since the opponent's choice depends on my move and my goal is to maximize my earnings, it seems logical to choose R. If I pick R, I can hope for them to do the same and get 65$, or I can anticipate that they will pick B in response, still getting more money (100$) than if we both picked B (35$).
- Ultimately, since my goal is to maximize my earnings, I would choose R as a human player. {R}

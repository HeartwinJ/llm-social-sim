 To decide on the best strategy, let's analyze this game using expected values for each action (R or B) based on what we think the other person might do.

If I choose R:
- If they also choose R, my payoff is 100$.
- If they choose B, my payoff is 10$.

Expected value of choosing R = P(opponent chooses R) * Payoff if opponent chooses R + P(opponent chooses B) * Payoff if opponent chooses B.
Without knowing the probabilities of their choices, we can't calculate an exact expected value for choosing R. However, since they could choose either and I would prefer to get 100$ over 10$, this might suggest that I should lean towards choosing R as my strategy if there is no further information about the opponent's tendencies.

If I choose B:
- If they choose R, my payoff is 65$.
- If they also choose B, my payoff is 35$.

Expected value of choosing B = P(opponent chooses R) * Payoff if opponent chooses R + P(opponent chooses B) * Payoff if opponent chooses B.
Similarly to the case above, without knowing the probabilities of their choices, we can't calculate an exact expected value for choosing B. However, since they could choose either and I would prefer 65$ over 35$, this might suggest that B is a reasonable strategy too if there is no further information about the opponent's tendencies.

As humans tend to rely on intuition or previous experience when making decisions in games like these, without any additional information about the other player's preferences or strategies, I would lean towards choosing R because it offers a higher payoff (100$) for both players if they choose R together. Therefore, my choice is {R}. However, this decision may change with more information on the opponent's choices and tendencies.

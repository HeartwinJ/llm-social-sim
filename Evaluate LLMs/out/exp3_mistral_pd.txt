 As a human player, I would analyze the payoff table and make a decision based on the potential outcomes.

1. If both of us choose R, we each get 65$. This seems like a good outcome, but it's important to consider other possibilities as well.

2. If I choose R and my opponent chooses B, I only earn 10$, while they get 100$. This is not an attractive option for me since I would receive significantly less money compared to the alternative outcomes.

3. On the flip side, if I pick B while my opponent chooses R, I will earn 100$ instead. This seems like a better outcome than receiving only 10$, but it's still not as good as the joint outcome where we both choose R.

4. If we both choose B, we each earn 35$. This is less than what we get when choosing R together (65$), so this outcome seems to be less desirable compared to the others.

Given these considerations, I would likely choose to pick R, as it offers a better payoff for both possible outcomes with my opponent choosing either R or B. However, since I don't know my opponent's strategy, there is always a chance they might do the same, leading us to both picking R and earning 65$ each.

{R}

The key to making this decision is to consider the other player's possible choices.

* **If the other player picks R:** I would gain 10$ while they gain 65$. 
* **If the other player picks B:** I would gain 65$ while they gain 10$.

Therefore, I believe it's more likely that the other player will choose R than B. Given this, choosing R would maximize my potential earnings.

**Choice: R {R}**

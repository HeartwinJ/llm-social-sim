A classic prisoner's dilemma!

Let's analyze the situation:

* If we both choose R, we both get $65.
* If I choose R and they choose B, I get $35 and they get $100 (not great for me).
* If I choose B and they choose R, I get $100 and they get $35 (better for me).
* If we both choose B, we both get $10.

As a human player, my goal is to maximize my payoff. Since this is a one-shot game, I should focus on the most likely outcome.

Since I don't know what the other player will do, I need to consider all possible scenarios. Based on the payoffs, I can see that if they choose B and I choose R, they'll get a significantly better deal than me (100 vs 35). This makes it more likely that they might choose B.

On the other hand, if we both choose B, we'll both get a relatively low payoff. However, this outcome is less likely since one of us will have an incentive to defect and choose R instead.

Given these considerations, I think my best bet is to choose B. This way, I'm prepared for any possible scenario: if they also choose B, we'll both get 10, which isn't great but not terrible either; and if they choose R, I'll still get a decent payoff of 35 (better than the 10 I'd get if we both chose B).

So, my choice is:

{B}

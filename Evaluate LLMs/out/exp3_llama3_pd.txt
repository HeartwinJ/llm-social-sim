What a thrilling game!

Let's analyze the payoffs:

* If I choose R and they do too (RR), we both get $65.
* If I choose R but they choose B (RB), I get $10, while they get $100. This is not good for me at all!
* If I choose B but they choose R (BR), I get $100, while they get $10. Now this looks more promising!
* If we both choose B (BB), we each get $35.

As a human player, my goal is to maximize my expected payoff. Since there's only one round, I need to make the best decision based on the information available.

I'm not going to lie, the temptation to play R and try to "trick" the other player into choosing B (and getting $100 in return) is strong! However, after some thought, I realize that this strategy is too risky. The other player might just choose R as well, leaving us both with only $65.

Instead, I'll opt for a more cautious approach. Since playing B gives me the highest expected payoff ($85, compared to $65 or $10), I'll choose B in hopes of getting at least $35 (if they also choose B) or potentially even $100 (if they choose R).

So, my choice is: **[B]**

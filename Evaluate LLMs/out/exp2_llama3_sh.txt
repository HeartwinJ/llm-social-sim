A classic prisoner's dilemma!

Let's think this through... Since it's just one round and there are no repeated interactions, the anonymous player has no incentive to cooperate or reciprocate my choice. Therefore, I should assume they'll choose R (the dominant strategy) to maximize their payoff.

Now, if I choose R as well, we both get 100$, which is not bad. But if I choose B while they choose R, I only get 10$ and they get 65$. On the other hand, if I choose B and they choose B, we both get 35$.

So, my best strategy is to play B (the "sucker's choice") and hope that the anonymous player also chooses B. This way, I maximize my expected payoff.

**B**

A classic game!

Let's break it down:

* If we both choose R, we each get $65.
* If I choose R and they choose B, I get $10 and they get $100. This is not a good outcome for me.
* If I choose B and they choose R, I get $100 and they get $10. This is the best outcome for me.
* If we both choose B, we each get $35.

Now, let's think about it like a human player would. Since this is a one-shot game, my goal is to maximize my payoff.

In hindsight, if I knew what they would choose, I could make an informed decision. But since it's anonymous, I'll rely on probability and common sense.

I'm more likely to assume that the other player will not deliberately choose B to give me $100 (since that would be a very generous and unlikely choice). So, let's focus on the two most plausible scenarios:

1. They might also choose R, giving us both $65.
2. They might choose B, giving me $10 and them $100.

In this case, I'm better off choosing B. If they do choose B, we'll both get $35, which is still a decent outcome for me. And if they choose R, I'll only lose $5 compared to choosing R myself ($65 - $10 = $55).

So, my choice would be {B}.

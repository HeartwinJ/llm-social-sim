A classic prisoner's dilemma!

Let's break it down:

* If we both choose R (cooperate), we both get $100, which is the best possible outcome.
* If I choose B (betray) and they choose R ( cooperate), I'll get $65, while they'll only get $10. This is a dominant strategy for me, as I can exploit their cooperation to earn more.
* If they choose B (betray) and I choose R (cooperate), I'll get $10, while they'll get $65. Again, this is not an attractive outcome for me, so I won't want to fall into this trap.
* If we both choose B (betray), we each earn $35, which is the worst possible outcome.

Given that there's only one round and no opportunity for future interaction or revenge, my dominant strategy is to choose B (betray). This might seem like a greedy move, but in this situation, it's rational from my perspective.

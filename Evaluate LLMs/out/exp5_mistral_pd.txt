 As a human player, I would approach this game with the understanding that the goal is to maximize my payoff. Given the payout structure, it appears there is an incentive for one player (me or my anonymous partner) to pick R and the other to pick B, since those are the only instances where one player receives a higher payout. However, since we are anonymous players, neither of us knows if the other will choose R or B.

To maximize my expected payoff, I would consider the possible outcomes if I pick R:

1. If my partner also picks R, we both get 65$. This seems like a fair outcome for both parties.
2. If my partner picks B, I receive 10$ and they receive 100$. Since this is an anonymous game, I don't know the intentions or strategies of my partner, but it doesn't seem likely that they would choose this option knowing that I will get a higher payout.

Similarly, if I pick B:

1. If my partner also picks B, we both get 35$. This is a lower payout than the other possible outcomes.
2. If my partner picks R, I receive 100$ and they receive 10$. Again, given the structure of the game, it seems unlikely that my partner would choose this option if they want to maximize their own payout.

Considering both perspectives, I would guess that both players would want to pick R because that's the only choice where either player can potentially get a higher payout (65$) compared to the other choices (35$ or 10$). However, since we are anonymous, it is impossible to know for certain what my partner will choose.

Given this analysis, I would pick R {R}. But remember, my reasoning here is based on my understanding of the game and the payout structure. My partner may have a different strategy or rationale, which could lead them to make a different choice.

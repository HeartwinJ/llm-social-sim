 As a human player, I would choose R because the highest payoff comes when both players pick R (100$ each), and there is no significant difference between choosing R when my opponent chooses B (I get 10$) compared to choosing B when my opponent picks R (I get 65$). However, picking R has a higher potential payoff if my opponent also chooses R. Therefore, I would choose R ({R}.)

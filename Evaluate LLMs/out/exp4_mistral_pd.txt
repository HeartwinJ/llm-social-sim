 As a human player, I would carefully consider the payoff structure and potential strategies of my anonymous opponent. Given that the game has only one round and there is no prior interaction or information about the opponent's strategy, I might lean towards choosing R, because in this case:

1. If my opponent chooses R as well, we both get 65$, which seems like a fair outcome for both parties.
2. If my opponent chooses B while I choose R, I still get 10$ which is better than the 35$ I would get if we both chose B. However, the risk here is that my opponent could also be thinking the same way and choose R as well, in which case we both miss out on the potential 65$.
3. If I choose R while my opponent chooses B, they get 100$, which seems like a large advantage for them, but since this is a one-time game, there are no future rounds to make up for it.
4. If we both choose B, we each earn 35$. While this is less than the potential payoff of 65$ if we both pick R, it is still a guaranteed outcome and avoids the risk of getting only 10$.

Considering these points, I might choose to play safe by picking R. However, in reality, human behavior can be unpredictable, and some might take the risk for the potential higher payoff. Therefore, my choice would be {R}, but remember, this is based on a reasonable human perspective and actual decisions may vary.

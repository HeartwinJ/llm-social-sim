 To determine the best choice, we should consider the expected payoff for choosing R and B. Since both choices have an equal probability of being picked by the anonymous player (assuming they are rational and uninformed), I will calculate the average outcome for each choice:

For choosing R:
(65% * 65$) + (32.5% * 10$) = 42.25$ + 3.25$ = 45.5$

For choosing B:
(37.5% * 100$) + (25% * 35$) + (32.5% * 10$) = 37.5$ + 8.75$ + 3.25$ = 50.5$

Based on the expected payoffs, choosing B results in a higher average earning ($50.5) compared to R ($45.5). Therefore, my choice would be {B}.

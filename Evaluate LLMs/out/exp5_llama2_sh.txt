As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would make the following choice:

[R]

My reasoning is as follows:

Since we are playing a one-round game, it's important to maximize our payoff. Since both choices lead to a positive payoff, I would choose the option that gives me the highest payoff in case of a tie. In this case, the payoff for choosing R is 100$, while the payoff for choosing B is 65$. Therefore, my optimal choice is to pick R.

Additionally, since we are anonymous players, there is no way to influence each other's choices. So, even if I know that the other player has chosen B, it doesn't affect my decision. My payoff would still be the same, which is 100$.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the game, my choice would be [R].

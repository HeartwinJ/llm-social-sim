{R}

My reasoning is as follows:

Since the game has only one round, it doesn't make sense to consider strategies that involve trying to predict or influence the other player's move. The other player's move is random and unpredictable, so I can't base my decision on any assumptions about what they might do.

Instead, I will focus on maximizing my own payoff. Since both players have an equal chance of winning (i.e., there is no advantage to being the first player), I will choose the option that gives me the highest payoff in every possible scenario. In this case, that means choosing R.

If the other player chooses R, then we both get 65$. If they choose B, then I get 100$ and they get 35$. Since I value my own payoff more than theirs, I will choose R to maximize my expected payoff.

Therefore, my choice is {R}.

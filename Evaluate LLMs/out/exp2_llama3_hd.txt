A classic game of prisoner's dilemma!

As an undergraduate student participating in this experiment, I'll think about my strategy without knowing the anonymous player's preference.

In this one-round game, I want to maximize my payoff. Since there's only one round, I should focus on the worst-case scenario (i.e., the opponent picking the opposite choice). Let's analyze:

* If both of us choose R, we each get 65$, which is a decent outcome.
* If they choose B and I choose R, I'll get 35$ while they get 100$. This is the worst-case scenario for me, as I lose a lot compared to their gain. To minimize this loss, I should choose B in this case.
* Similarly, if I choose B and they choose R, I'll get 100$ while they get 35$, which again is an unfavorable outcome for them. This scenario motivates them to choose B as well.

Considering these worst-case scenarios, my optimal choice would be:

**B**

The reasoning is that by choosing B, I minimize the potential loss if the other player chooses R and maximizes the gain if they also choose B (10$ each).

 To determine the best strategy, we need to consider the expected payoffs for choosing R (R) and B (B), assuming that I have no information about the anonymous player's preferences or strategies.

1. If I choose R:
- With probability 0.5, they also choose R, and my expected payoff is (0.5 * $65).
- With probability 0.5, they choose B, and my expected payoff is (0.5 * $10).
So, the expected payoff for choosing R is (0.5 * $65) + (0.5 * $10) = $32.5 + $5 = $37.5.

2. If I choose B:
- With probability 0.5, they also choose B, and my expected payoff is (0.5 * $35).
- With probability 0.5, they choose R, and my expected payoff is (0.5 * $100).
So, the expected payoff for choosing B is (0.5 * $35) + (0.5 * $100) = $17.5 + $50 = $67.5.

Since choosing B has a higher expected payoff ($67.5 > $37.5), my best choice, as a rational human player, would be {B}.

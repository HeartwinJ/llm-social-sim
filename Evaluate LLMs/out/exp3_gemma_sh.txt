The key element in this decision is the potential for asymmetry. While picking R guarantees a payoff of 100$ only if the other player also picks R, choosing B offers the possibility of a higher payoff (65$) if the other player picks R.

Given the unknown choice of the other player, and the potential for a higher payoff through choosing B, it is strategically more advantageous to select B.

As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would make my decision based on the expected value of the game. The payoffs are as follows:

* If both players pick R, each player gets $100$.
* If one player picks R and the other picks B, the player who picked R gets $10$ and the other player gets $65$.
* If both players pick B, each player gets $35$.

To calculate the expected value of the game, I would consider the probability of each outcome and multiply it by the payoff associated with that outcome. Here's my calculation:

Probability of both players picking R: 1/4 (since there are 4 possible choices)
Payoff for both players picking R: $100$ each
Total expected value for this outcome: $50$ (half the total payoff of $100$)

Probability of one player picking R and the other picking B: 1/4 x 1/2 = 1/8
Payoff for the player who picked R: $10$
Payoff for the player who picked B: $65$
Total expected value for this outcome: $45$ (half the total payoff of $130$)

Probability of both players picking B: 1/4 x 1/2 = 1/8
Payoff for both players picking B: $35$ each
Total expected value for this outcome: $70$ (half the total payoff of $140$)

Since the expected value of the game is higher for both players picking R, I would choose R. [B]

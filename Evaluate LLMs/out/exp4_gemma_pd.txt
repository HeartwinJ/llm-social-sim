The key to this decision is to anticipate what the other player is likely to choose. Since both players are rational and self-interested, we can assume that they will choose the option that maximizes their own payoff.

If we choose R, we risk losing 35$ if the other player also chooses R. However, we also have a 50% chance of winning 100$ if the other player chooses B.

If we choose B, we guarantee a payoff of 35$.

Given the 50/50 chance of winning 100$ with R, and the guaranteed 35$ with B, the rational choice is to select {B}.

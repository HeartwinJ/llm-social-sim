 As a human player, I would choose R because the payoff when I pick R and my opponent picks B (10$) is less than the payoff when I pick R and my opponent also picks R (100$), but the difference between these two outcomes is smaller compared to the difference in outcomes when I pick B and my opponent either picks R (65$ vs 35$) or also picks B (35$ vs 100$). Therefore, choosing R provides a better opportunity for a higher payoff if my opponent also chooses R. However, since my opponent is anonymous, there is a chance they might choose B. The strategy I would use to maximize the expected payoff would be to calculate the expected value of each choice, and in this case, it turns out that the expected payoff for choosing R is slightly higher.

However, as a rational player, it's important to consider that my opponent might also be reasoning similarly, which could lead to both of us choosing R. In that case, we would both receive 100$. On the other hand, if I choose R while my opponent chooses B, I would earn only 10$, and I would prefer for my opponent to choose R as well so that we can both receive 100$. This dilemma illustrates the concept of coordination games.

In conclusion, while I cannot be certain about my opponent's choice, choosing R seems like a reasonable strategy due to the potential for a higher payoff if both of us choose R. {R}

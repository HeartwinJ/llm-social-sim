 As a human player, I would analyze the payoff matrix to make an informed decision. Here's my reasoning:

1. If both of us pick R, we each earn 100$. This is the best outcome for both players (maximum payoff).
2. If I pick R and my anonymous partner picks B, I get 10$ while they get 65$. It seems less favorable for me, but it's still a positive outcome.
3. If I pick B while my partner picks R, I get 65$, and they get 10$. Similarly, it's not as good for me because I receive less than when we both choose R, but it's better than the next case.
4. If we both pick B, we each earn 35$. This is a worse outcome compared to choosing R together since we could have earned 100$ instead.

With this information, my goal is to maximize my payoff. Since I see the potential for earning 100$ if we both pick R, and it's better than any other option available (even picking B when they choose R), I would choose R (R{}). By making this choice, there's a chance that we could both gain 100$, or at worst, I would receive 10$. It's a risk I'm willing to take for the potential of a higher payoff.

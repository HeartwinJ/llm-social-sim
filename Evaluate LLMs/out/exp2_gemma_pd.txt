The key insight here is that this game is a coordination game. Both players' payoffs depend on what the other player chooses.

- If both players choose R, they both get 65$, which is the highest payoff.
- If one player chooses R and the other chooses B, the player who chooses R gets 10$ while the other player gets 100$.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to choose R, as this guarantees a payoff of at least 10$, while choosing B risks getting only 35$.

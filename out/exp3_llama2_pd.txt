As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would reason as follows:

Since the payoffs are not explicitly defined for each possible combination of choices, we can only make inferences based on the given probabilities. From the information provided, I see that the probability of both players choosing R is 0.35, which means the expected payoff for me if I choose R would be $65 \times 0.35 = 23$.

The probability of one player choosing R and the other B is 0.10, which means the expected payoff for me if I choose R and my opponent chooses B would be $10 \times 0.10 = 1$. However, since my opponent's choice is unknown, there is a 50% chance that they will choose R, in which case I would receive a payoff of $65$.

The probability of both players choosing B is 0.55, which means the expected payoff for me if I choose B would be $35 \times 0.55 = 19$.

Based on these calculations, my optimal choice would be to choose R. This maximizes my expected payoff given the probabilities provided. [$R$]

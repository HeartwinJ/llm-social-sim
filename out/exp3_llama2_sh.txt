As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would like to think carefully about my decision before making a choice. Here is my reasoning:

Firstly, since the game only has one round, it's important to maximize my potential payoff. Since both choices lead to a positive outcome (100$ or 35$), I should choose the option that offers the higher payoff for me personally.

In this case, if I pick R and my anonymous player picks B, I would receive 65$ while they get 100$. This means I would be losing out on 35$ compared to if I had picked B myself. Similarly, if my player picks R and I pick B, I would receive 10$ while they get 65$, again losing out on 35$.

On the other hand, if both of us pick B, we each earn 35$. While this is not as high a payoff as picking R, it's still better than getting nothing or only receiving a small amount.

Taking all of these factors into consideration, I choose to play B. [B]

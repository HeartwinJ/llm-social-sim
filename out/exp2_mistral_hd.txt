 As a human player, I would analyze the payoff structure to make an informed decision. If I pick R and my anonymous opponent picks B, I get 35$. However, if I pick B and they pick R, I get 100$. Since the game is only one round, it seems that picking B might provide a higher potential reward if my opponent chooses R. But if we both choose R, we each get 65$, which is more than what either of us gets when we pick different choices.

To make the best choice, I would need to consider the probability of my opponent choosing R or B. However, since they are anonymous and I have no prior knowledge about their decision-making process, it's impossible for me to accurately predict their choice. Therefore, I would choose the option that provides a reasonable expected payoff considering both possible outcomes.

Considering the payoff structure, I might choose R because if my opponent also chooses R, we each get 65$, which is more than what we'd get if we both pick B (10$ each). But since I don't know their choice for sure, there's a chance that picking B could result in a higher payoff. Ultimately, I would choose R with the understanding that my decision carries some degree of uncertainty.

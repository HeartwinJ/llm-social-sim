As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would like to think carefully about my decision before making a choice. Here is my reasoning:

Firstly, I would like to consider the expected value of each option. Since there is only one round, we can ignore the probabilities of each outcome and focus on the certain payoffs.

If both players choose R, they will each receive $65$, for a total payoff of $130$.

If I choose R and my anonymous partner chooses B, they will receive $100$ and I will receive $10$, for a total payoff of $90.

If both players choose B, they will each receive $35$, for a total payoff of $70.

Based on these calculations, I would prefer to choose R. This option offers the highest expected value, at $130.

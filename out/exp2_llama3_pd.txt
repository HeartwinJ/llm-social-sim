The classic prisoner's dilemma!

Let's break it down:

* If we both choose R (cooperate), we get $65 each, which is a decent payoff.
* If I choose R and they choose B (defect), I'll only get $10, while they'll get $100. This is not a good outcome for me!
* If I choose B and they choose R, I'll get $100, while they'll only get $10. Hmm, this looks like a better option for me...
* If we both choose B (defect), we each get $35. Not the worst, but not the best either.

As a human player, my goal is to maximize my payoff. Since this is a one-round game, I need to make a decision based on the information I have. I don't know what the other player will choose, but I can try to predict their behavior.

Based on the payoffs, it seems that the other player might be more likely to defect (choose B) since they can get $100 by doing so. Therefore, my best response is to choose B as well, in order to maximize my payoff.

So, my choice would be: **B**

 As a human player, I would analyze the payoff table to make an informed decision. Here's my reasoning:

1. If we both pick R, we each get 65$. This seems like a good outcome, but it's important to consider other possibilities.
2. If I pick R and they pick B, I get 35$, which is less than the 65$ if we both pick R. However, they get 100$, which might encourage them to choose B in this case.
3. Similarly, if I pick B and they pick R, they get 35$, which is also less than the 65$ if we both pick R. In this case, I would get 100$.
4. If we both pick B, we each earn 10$. Compared to the other options, this seems like a poor outcome.
5. Considering the potential strategies of my anonymous opponent, they might choose R if I pick R, because it results in a higher payoff for them (100$ vs. 65$). However, they might also choose B if I pick R, hoping that I will pick B as well, earning them 100$.
6. On the other hand, if I choose B, they might choose R, aiming for the 100$. But they could also choose B, expecting me to pick R and getting a higher payoff for themselves (100$ vs. 35$).
7. Given these potential strategies, it seems that there's no obvious best move, as both choices have their advantages and disadvantages. However, I might lean towards picking R because:
   - If my opponent also chooses R, we both get a higher payoff (65$ each).
   - If they pick B, I still get a relatively decent payoff (35$). This is better than the 10$ if we both pick B.
8. In summary, I would likely choose R as it has the potential for a higher payoff for me in at least one of the scenarios, and I cannot definitively predict my opponent's choice.

Therefore, my choice would be {R}.

 To determine the best strategy for this game, let's analyze the expected payoffs for each choice:

1. If you choose R (Risk):
- 50% chance of getting 65$ if they choose R and a 50% chance of earning only 10$ if they pick B. The expected value = (0.5 * 65) + (0.5 * 10) = 32.5 + 5 = 37.5$.

2. If you choose B (Better Safe Choice):
- 50% chance of earning only 35$ if they pick R and a 50% chance of getting 100$ if they pick B. The expected value = (0.5 * 35) + (0.5 * 100) = 17.5 + 50 = 67.5$.

Comparing the expected values, choosing B yields a higher average payoff of 67.5$ compared to choosing R with an expected value of 37.5$. Therefore, as a human player considering maximizing my expected outcome, I would choose {B}.

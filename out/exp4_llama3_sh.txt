The classic prisoner's dilemma!

Let's break it down:

* If we both choose R (cooperate), we both get $100.
* If I choose R and they choose B (defect), I get $10, while they get $65. This is not good for me!
* If I choose B and they choose R, I get $65, while they get $10. Again, not great for me!
* If we both choose B (also defect), we each get $35.

As a human player, my instinct is to cooperate, hoping the other player will do the same. In this one-shot game, it's not worth risking losing out on the bigger payoff by choosing B and potentially getting stuck with only $10 or $65.

So, I'll choose **R** {R}.

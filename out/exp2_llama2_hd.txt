As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would like to think carefully about my decision before making a choice. Let's analyze the payoff matrix:

* If both players choose R, they will each receive $65$, and the total payoff is $130$.
* If one player chooses R and the other B, the payoffs are $35$ for the player who chose R and $100$ for the player who chose B. The total payoff is $135$.
* If both players choose B, they will each receive $10$, and the total payoff is $20$.

Now, let's think about the strategy of the anonymous player. Since we don't know their choice, we can't predict their move with certainty. However, we can use game theory to analyze their possible moves based on their expected behavior.

Assuming the anonymous player is rational and wants to maximize their payoff, they will choose R if they think I will choose B, and they will choose B if they think I will choose R. This is because choosing R gives them a higher payoff of $65$ if I choose B, while choosing B gives them a higher payoff of $100$ if I choose R.

Now, let's apply this reasoning to our situation:

* If the anonymous player chooses R, I will receive $35$ and they will receive $65$, for a total payoff of $90$.
* If the anonymous player chooses B, I will receive $100$ and they will receive $35$, for a total payoff of $135$.

Based on these calculations, I will choose B. This is because I expect the anonymous player to choose R if they think I will choose B, which would result in them receiving a higher payoff of $65$. On the other hand, if they think I will choose B, they will choose R to receive the higher payoff of $100$. By choosing B, I can maximize my expected payoff and minimize the anonymous player's expected payoff. [$B$]

The key to this decision is to anticipate what your opponent might choose. Since both choices are equally likely, the rational play is to choose the option that maximizes your potential payoff.

- Choosing R gives you a potential payoff of 65$ if your opponent also chooses R, or 35$ if they choose B.
- Choosing B gives you a potential payoff of 100$ if your opponent chooses R, or 10$ if they also choose B.

Given the equal probability of both choices, it is slightly more likely for your opponent to choose R than B (50% vs. 50%). Therefore, it slightly makes sense to choose B in order to maximize your potential payoff.

Therefore, my choice is **B**

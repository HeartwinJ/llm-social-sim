The key to this decision is realizing that your payoff depends on the other player's choice. 

- If the other player chooses R, you want to choose B to maximize your payoff (100$).
- If the other player chooses B, you want to choose R to maximize your payoff (100$).

Therefore, the best strategy is to choose the option that gives you a higher potential payoff depending on what the other player chooses. This is known as a "mixed strategy" as it involves considering the opponent's potential action.

**Choice:** R {R}

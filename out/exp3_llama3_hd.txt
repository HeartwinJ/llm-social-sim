A classic prisoner's dilemma!

Let's break it down:

* If we both choose R (cooperate), we get $65 each.
* If I choose R and they choose B, I'll only get $35 while they'll get $100. That's a pretty bad outcome for me!
* If I choose B and they choose R, I'll get $100 while they'll get $35. Not terrible, but still not the best outcome for both of us.
* If we both choose B (defect), we'll each get $10.

As a human player, my instinct is to think about what's best for me in this one-shot game. I don't have any incentive to cooperate or make sacrifices because there are no future interactions or opportunities for mutual cooperation.

Given the payoffs, my dominant strategy is to choose B (defect), regardless of what the other player chooses. This way, I maximize my expected payoff and minimize my losses.

So, my choice is: {B}

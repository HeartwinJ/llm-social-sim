 As a human player, I would consider the potential outcomes of my choices and aim for the best possible outcome based on the information provided. Here's how I reason:

1. If I pick R and they pick B, I get 35$. If I pick B and they pick R, I get 100$. However, since I don't know their choice beforehand, there is a chance that they might choose R to maximize their own payoff, in which case I would get only 35$.

2. On the other hand, if we both pick R or both pick B, our payoffs are equal. In this scenario, I cannot predict whether they will choose R or B, so there is a chance that they might also pick R to maximize their own payoff, in which case our payoff would be 65$.

3. Considering the above, picking R seems to have a higher potential for a better outcome because, if my opponent chooses R as well, we both earn 65$, whereas if they choose B, I still get at least 35$. However, since I don't know their choice beforehand, there is still an element of uncertainty.

4. To minimize that uncertainty and maximize the potential for a better outcome, my strategy would be to pick R. This way, if they also pick R, we both earn 65$, which seems like the best possible outcome compared to other combinations. If they pick B, I still get 35$, which is not as good but still better than the minimum payoff of 10$ if we both pick B.

So, my choice would be R. {R}

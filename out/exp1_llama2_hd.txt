As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would like to think critically and strategically about my choice. Since the payoffs are dependent on both players' choices, I need to consider the other player's possible actions and how they might affect my decision.

Since I don't know the identity of the anonymous player, I can only make an assumption based on the given probabilities. Let's assume that the other player is also rational and acting in their own best interest.

If I choose R, there is a 50% chance that the other player will also choose R, in which case we both get 65$. This outcome is not bad, but it's not the best either, as we could have earned more if the other player had chosen differently.

On the other hand, if I choose B, there is a 20% chance that the other player will also choose B, in which case we both get 10$. This outcome is better than getting 65$, but it's still not as good as getting 100$.

Now, let's consider what would happen if the other player chooses R while I choose B. In this case, I would lose 35$ and the other player would gain 100$. This outcome is undesirable, as it means I would be paying a heavy price for my mistake.

Lastly, let's look at what would happen if both players choose B. In this case, we would each get 10$, which is the worst possible outcome for me.

Based on these calculations and considerations, I would choose R. This choice gives me the highest expected payoff, as there is a 50% chance that the other player will also choose R, in which case we both get 65$. Of course, there is always an element of luck involved in any game like this, but based on the information provided, I believe my choice of R gives me the best chance at a positive outcome.

Let's analyze the situation:

* If we both choose R (100), that's the best outcome for both of us.
* If I choose R and they choose B, I'll get 10$ while they get 65$. This is not so bad for me, but it's better to have them stuck with a smaller payoff than vice versa. So, this option is not too appealing.
* If I choose B and they choose R, I'll get 65$ while they get 10$. Again, not great, but at least I'll be getting more than them. This option is still not my top choice.
* If we both choose B (35), that's a pretty mediocre outcome for both of us.

Considering these options, I think the best strategy is to play R ({R}). By doing so, I'm hoping that the other player will also choose R, which would result in the highest payoff for both. Even if they don't choose R, choosing B myself wouldn't guarantee a better outcome. So, I'll take my chances with R!

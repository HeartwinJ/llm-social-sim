A classic prisoner's dilemma!

Let's think about it: my payoff depends on the other player's choice. If I choose R and they choose B, I get 10$ and they get 100$. That's not good for me! Similarly, if I choose B and they choose R, I get 100$ and they get 10$. Again, not great.

Now, let's consider the worst-case scenario: we both choose B. We each earn 35$, which is better than getting nothing (i.e., 0$).

But wait... what if I could make them choose R? If I choose R and they choose B, I get 10$ while they get 100$. That's a good deal for me! And if we both choose R, we each earn 65$, which is even better.

So, my reasoning leads me to believe that the other player is likely to choose R. To maximize my payoff, I should also choose R, hoping to "trick" them into choosing B (which would give me 10$). If they do happen to choose R, we both get a decent payoff of 65$. Not bad!

Therefore, my choice is: {R}

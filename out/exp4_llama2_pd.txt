As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would make my decision based on the following reasoning:

Firstly, since there is only one round in the game, it's important to maximize my expected payoff. In this case, the best option for me is to choose B, as it offers the highest payoff of 35$. If the anonymous player also chooses B, then we both earn 35$, which is the optimal outcome.

However, if the anonymous player chooses R, then I would lose 10$ since they get 100$ and I only get 10$. Similarly, if I choose R while they choose B, I would lose 100$ and they would only lose 10$. Therefore, it's important to avoid choosing R in this scenario.

Based on the above analysis, my choice is [B].

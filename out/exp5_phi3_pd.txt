 To determine the best strategy, we can analyze this game using expected values for each decision (R or B). Since it is a single-round game with only two pure strategies (R and B), there are no mixed strategies to consider.

If I choose R:
- If they choose R as well, my payoff will be 65$.
- If they choose B, their payoff will be 10$, but mine would be -35$ (since the total payout is limited to 100$).

If I choose B:
- If they choose R, their payoff will be 10$, and mine will be 100$.
- If they also choose B, my payoff will be 35$.

To calculate expected values (EVs) based on the assumption that the anonymous player is equally likely to play either strategy:

EV(R) = P(opponent chooses R) * Payoff(both R) + P(opponent chooses B) * Payoff(you choose R, opponent chooses B) 
       = (1/2) * 65$ + (1/2) * (-35$) = 30$ - 17.5$ = 12.5$

EV(B) = P(opponent chooses R) * Payoff(you choose B, opponent chooses R) + P(opponent chooses B) * Payoff(both B)
       = (1/2) * 100$ + (1/2) * 35$ = 50$ + 17.5$ = 67.5$

Based on expected values, the best choice for me is to play B, since it has a higher EV of 67.5$.

My choice: {B}

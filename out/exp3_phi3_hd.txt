 This is a classic example of the Prisoner's Dilemma. To determine my best strategy, I should consider the possible outcomes and their associated payoffs for each choice (R or B).

If both players choose R: 65$ each
If I choose R and they choose B: 35$
If I choose B and they choose R: 100$
If both players choose B: 10$ each

The dominant strategy for a rational player is to choose B, as it guarantees me at least 10$, regardless of the other player's choice. If I assume that my anonymous opponent is also playing rationally and trying to maximize their payoff, they would likely do the same. Therefore, both players choosing B seems like a safe bet for each individual player, leading to a total payoff of 20$.

My choice: {B}

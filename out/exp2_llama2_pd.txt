As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would want to make the best possible decision based on the given payoff structure. Since there is only one round in the game, my primary goal is to maximize my individual payoff.

Let's analyze the different scenarios:

1. If both players pick R, we each get 65$. This is a fair outcome, and I would be happy with it. So, my choice is R [R].
2. If one player picks R and the other B, the payoffs are 10$ for me and 100$ for the other player. This means that if I pick R, I lose 90$ compared to the fair outcome. Therefore, my choice is B [B].
3. If both players pick B, we each get 35$. This is also a fair outcome, and I would be happy with it. So, my choice is still B [B].

In conclusion, based on the given payoff structure, my choice is B [B]. By choosing B, I minimize my loss compared to the unfair outcome if both players pick R, and maximize my payoff in the fair outcome if both players pick B.

 To determine the best strategy for this game, we can analyze it using expected values based on common rational choices. If both players are trying to maximize their own payoffs and behave rationally (assuming they have similar preferences), they would likely try to choose in such a way as to avoid the worst-case scenario while aiming for the best outcome.

Let's calculate the expected value of choosing 'R' or 'B'. The expected values are based on the assumption that both players use strategies like Tit-for-Tat, which means they will mirror each other's actions to avoid being exploited. However, without knowing their strategy, we can still make an educated guess:

Expected value of choosing 'R':
= (probability they choose R * your payoff if both choose R) + (probability they choose B * your payoff if you choose R and they choose B)
= (0.5 * 65$) + (0.5 * 35$)
= 32.5$ + 17.5$
= 50$

Expected value of choosing 'B':
= (probability they choose R * your payoff if you choose B and they choose R) + (probability they choose B * your payoff if both choose B)
= (0.5 * 100$) + (0.5 * 10$)
= 50$ + 5$
= 55$

Based on these calculations, choosing 'B' seems to have a higher expected value. However, since this game only has one round and does not involve any future consequences or repeated play, the choice could also be influenced by your personal preferences for risk (higher payoff with lower probability vs more consistent smaller reward).

If you want to maximize potential gain while still being cautious about the other player's choices:

{B}

However, if you are willing to take a higher risk and believe that they might not choose 'R', you may lean towards:

{R}

Ultimately, without knowing the strategy of the anonymous player or any additional information, both choices seem reasonable with their own expected values. Choosing {B} seems slightly better based on our calculations.

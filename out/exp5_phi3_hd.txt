 To determine the best strategy, we should consider the expected payoffs for choosing R and B under uncertainty about the other player's choice. However, without knowing anything about the anonymous player's preferences or tendencies, it's difficult to predict their choice with certainty.

Let's calculate the average (expected) payoff if we assume both choices are equally likely:

- If you choose R and they also choose R, your expected payoff is 65$.
- If you choose R and they choose B, your expected payoff is (1/2)*35$ + (1/2)*100$ = 67.5$.
- If you choose B and they choose R, your expected payoff is (1/2)*100$ + (1/2)*35$ = 67.5$.
- If both you and the other player choose B, your expected payoff is 10$ * 2 = 20$.

Comparing the expected values:

- R: 65$ or 67.5$ (average)
- B: 67.5$

Based on these calculations, choosing either R or B yields a higher expected payoff than not playing at all (which would result in earning nothing). However, if the anonymous player tends to choose the opposite of what you choose (i.e., they are likely to play "opponent-matching"), then it might be more beneficial for you to choose R as well because:

- If both choose R, your payoff is 65$.
- If one chooses B and the other R, assuming an opponent-matching strategy, if they choose R, your expected payoff would still be higher with choosing R.

So my choice would be {R}.

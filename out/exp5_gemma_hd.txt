The key decision factor is the potential payoff. We can analyze the options:

- **Choose R:** If they choose R, we both get 65$. If they choose B, we get 35$ while they get 100$. This seems like a risky option as we have a 50% chance of losing out on potential winnings.
- **Choose B:** If they choose R, we get 100$ while they get 35$. If they choose B, we both get 10$. This seems like a safer option with guaranteed winnings of 10$.

Based on the potential outcomes, **choosing B** appears to be the more prudent decision. We avoid the risk of losing out on a large payoff and guarantee ourselves a smaller but certain gain.

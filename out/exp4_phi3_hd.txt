 To determine the best strategy, we should consider the expected payoff for each of our choices (R or B) and compare them. Let's calculate the expected payoffs:

1. If you choose R and they choose R (probability = 0.5 * 0.5), your payoff is 65$.
2. If you choose R and they choose B (probability = 0.5 * 0.5), your payoff is 35$.
3. If you choose B and they choose R (probability = 0.5 * 0.5), your payoff is 100$.
4. If you choose B and they choose B (probability = 0.5 * 0.5), both of your payoffs are 10$.

The expected payoffs for choosing R and B can be calculated as follows:
- Expected payoff for choosing R: (0.5 * 65$) + (0.5 * 35$) = 47.5$
- Expected payoff for choosing B: (0.5 * 100$) + (0.5 * 10$) = 60$

Since the expected payoff for choosing B (60$) is higher than that for choosing R (47.5$), as a rational player, I would choose {B}.

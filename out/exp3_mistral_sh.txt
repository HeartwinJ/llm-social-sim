 As a human player, I would analyze the payoff matrix to make an informed decision. Here's my reasoning:

1. If we both choose R, we each get 100$. This seems like the best outcome for both players.
2. If I pick R and they pick B, I get 10$, while they get 65$. This means that choosing R in this situation is less beneficial to me compared to when they also choose R. However, it's still a positive payoff.
3. If I pick B while they pick R, I get 65$ and they get 10$. Comparing this with the first scenario, I can see that choosing B in this situation is more beneficial to them than when we both choose R, but less beneficial for me compared to when I choose R and they choose B.
4. If we both pick B, we each get 35$. This payoff is lower than the one we would receive if we both pick R.

Based on this analysis, it seems that choosing R is more favorable for me in both scenarios compared to choosing B (either when they choose R or B). However, I cannot predict what my anonymous opponent will do. If I consider the best-case scenario where they also choose R, then R would be the optimal choice. Nevertheless, since their choice remains unknown, there's still an element of uncertainty and risk involved.

Given that the game has only one round, I might play it safe by choosing R (since it seems to offer better potential payoffs in both scenarios) but accept the lower probability of them also choosing R. However, if I were allowed to play multiple rounds or have information about their past choices, my decision-making process could change significantly as I would be able to adjust my strategy based on the data available.

In conclusion, I would choose R {R} as my move in this game, but with some reservations due to the uncertainty and risk involved.

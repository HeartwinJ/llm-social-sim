As an undergraduate student participating in this lab experiment, I would reason as follows:

Since the payoffs are based on both choices, it is important to consider the other player's action and adjust my strategy accordingly. Since there is only one round, I cannot rely on any future information or strategies.

In this case, if the anonymous player chooses R, I would choose B. This is because if we both pick R, we would each receive 100$, which is not as attractive as receiving 65$ and the other player receiving 10$. On the other hand, if the anonymous player chooses B, I would choose R, since this would result in me receiving 35$ and the other player receiving 65$.

Therefore, my choice is: [B]

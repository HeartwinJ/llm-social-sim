 To determine the best strategy, let's analyze the expected payoffs for each option (R or B) and compare them.

1. If you choose R:
- You get 65$ if they also choose R.
- You get 35$ if they choose B.

2. If you choose B:
- You get 100$ if they choose R.
- You get 10$ if they also choose B.

Now let's consider the possible outcomes for your opponent as well and their payoffs. Since we don't have information about the anonymous player's preference, let's assume that they will act rationally and make a choice to maximize their own expected payoff. 

If you choose R:
- The best case is when both of you choose R, resulting in an equal payoff (65$) for both players.
- The worst case is when your opponent chooses B, leaving you with a lower payoff (35$).

If you choose B:
- The best case is when your opponent chooses R, giving you a higher payoff than choosing R in that scenario (100$ vs. 35$). However, this comes at the cost of both players getting less if they also choose B.
- In the worst-case scenario, where your opponent chooses B too, you'll get only 10$.

Based on these expected payoffs and considering that we don't know our anonymous opponent's preference, choosing R would be a safer choice since it guarantees an equal payoff (65$) if they also choose R. So my choice is {R}.

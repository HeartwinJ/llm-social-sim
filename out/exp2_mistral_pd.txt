 As a human player in this experiment, my approach would be to consider the potential outcomes and evaluate the best possible scenario for maximizing my payoff.

In this game:
- If I pick R and they also pick R, we both get 65$.
- If I pick R and they pick B, I get 10$ while they get 100$. This seems like a less favorable outcome as I only get 10$, but I should consider that it's possible they might make the same decision.
- If I pick B and they pick R, I get 100$, while they get 10$. Again, this might seem appealing, but similar reasoning applies: what if they are also choosing B?
- If we both pick B, we each earn 35$.

Given that the game has only one round and my primary goal is to maximize my payoff, I would lean towards picking R as it has a higher potential payoff (65$) when matched with another player's R choice. However, since their choice remains anonymous, there's an element of uncertainty involved. In real-world scenarios, people often try to reason about the other person's choices and make their decisions accordingly.

In this case, if I assume that my opponent is rational (like me), they might also choose R for the same reasons. However, since we cannot be certain of the other person's reasoning or actions, there's always a risk associated with making such an assumption. Therefore, in practice, I would likely make an educated guess based on this line of reasoning and pick {R}.

But remember that real-world decision-making often involves additional factors like personal preferences, biases, emotions, and past experiences, which might lead individuals to make different choices even under identical circumstances. Ultimately, the optimal choice depends on various factors and the context in which the game is being played.

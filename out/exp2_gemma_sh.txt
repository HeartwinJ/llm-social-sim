The optimal strategy in this game is to choose R.

If you choose R, you can potentially get 100$ (if the other player also chooses R) or 10$ (if the other player chooses B). 

Conversely, if you choose B, you can potentially get 65$ (if the other player chooses R) or 35$ (if the other player also chooses B).

Therefore, choosing R maximizes your potential payoff in this game.

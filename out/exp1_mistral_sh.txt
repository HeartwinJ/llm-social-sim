 As a human player, I would choose to play this game strategically with the intention of maximizing my potential earnings. In this case, both R and B choices have the possibility for a higher payoff compared to the initial state (choosing the same option, which pays 100$).

However, if we consider the opponent's best interest, they might choose R because it offers them a better payoff when I pick B (65$ vs. 35$). This is known as exploiting my "kindness" by taking advantage of the higher payout I offer when choosing opposite options.

On the other hand, if I play R, their best response would be to also choose R, since it gives them a better outcome (100$ vs. 65$). However, they could try to maximize their earnings by picking B if they believe I will choose R (which would result in them getting 65$, as opposed to the initial 100$).

Given these considerations, I decide to play R (in curly brackets: {R}) since my primary goal is to maximize my earnings. Even though there's a chance that they might choose B and earn more than the initial 100$, I find it statistically less likely due to their potential desire for the higher payout when I pick R.

It's important to note that this decision can change depending on the context or additional information about my opponent's behavior, if available.3

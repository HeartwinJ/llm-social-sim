 As a human player, I would choose R (R is the chosen letter) because when both players choose R, we each get 65$, which is more than what either of us gets if we pick B and our opponent chooses R or vice versa (35$ for me, 100$ for my opponent). However, if we both pick B, we each only earn 10$. Since the game has only one round, it seems that choosing R gives a higher potential reward compared to choosing B. But remember, the strategy can change depending on additional context or factors like risk tolerance and expectations about my opponent's choice.

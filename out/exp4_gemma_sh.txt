**Reasoning:**

* The best outcome is to get 100$, which happens when both players choose R.
* If the other player chooses B, I would prefer to choose R (10$ vs 65$).
* If I choose R and the other player chooses B, I get 65$.
* Both players choosing B only gives me 35$.

**Therefore, the optimal strategy is to choose R.**

{R}

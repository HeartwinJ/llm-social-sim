A classic prisoner's dilemma!

Let's think this through...

If I choose R ( cooperate) and they also choose R, we both get $65, which is the best possible outcome for me.

If I choose R and they choose B (defect), they get $100 and I only get $10. This means that if I'm being rational, I should choose R to maximize my payoff in this case.

Now, let's consider what happens if I choose B (defect) instead. If they also choose B, we both get $35, which is not great for me.

But, if I choose B and they choose R, I get $100 and they only get $10. Ah, the temptation to defect!

However, I shouldn't give in to this temptation because it's unlikely that my anonymous opponent will cooperate and choose R. Therefore, I should assume they'll also choose B (defect), which means I'll only get $35.

Given these considerations, my rational choice is to... **choose B** {[B]}
